## The Collection Description
[Our Streets, Our Stories](http://www.bklynlibrary.org/seniors/our-streets-our-stories-o) by [Brooklyn Public Library](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/) is an oral history project of the Brooklyn Public Libraryâ€™s Department of Outreach Services that seeks to explore the Brooklyn that is, and the Brooklyn that was, from the words of the community that lives there. The project aims to actively collect a broad range of stories from our diverse neighborhoods, so that future generations may better understand the history of the borough.
