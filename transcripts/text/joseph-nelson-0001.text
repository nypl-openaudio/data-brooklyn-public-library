I pray did go to prayer groups and I was a pretty good leader. I went
to jail and spoke with inmates I stepped in a gym
in the gym at night and supervised the homeless.
Out of my way just to stay overnight with them and pushes in the
church used to make to make a meal. Nice to feed the
homeless stay overnight with him. And I mean should
do you really did and what I read in court for you but Chris and then the then
the homeless bus used to take him back. I just kept in a shut overnight to
keep medical.
And then and I went directly to
work with it before you did
I already have before it isn't just before I went to
Samos for the law to say much but.
Whenever it in any way that when it is yes I could
do it like. From eighty seven
to two thousand

Isn't that a good to call home. And so so I will back and I I
I didn't go to church and then I asked my son is in charge of the church so

I felt a few a few times that my son's welcome. And I said oh

out of the church who was the lady's name is Dr
and I came in today. I came in to. I try to come into the library but it was
cause I pass by it was a big big thing like that.
And I looked in the
bag and helping up. It was all of twenty's and hundreds and
knowledgeably in the library and library steps. It was all
twenty's hundred credit cards in it so I said now what I do it is not my own shop made and I was
very big tonight when I go my
errands try printing I went and went to my
bank. And I called my wife and I said look I found as big as it was one.
So I went to my Jamaica owns one home.
I open to dating. I saw the number and then the lady just she just
made electro Gees one hundred dollars you are Jordan Chase it was a hundred she has
a credit card so I stand just that and then I call the lady and her name is Rosemary

day and I fast. Once a week a couple meals for the poor kids in the world and
one day a week but twenty years on me. I Wednesday and when I don't eat on Wednesday.

good charity I go to charity every day. And I can assure you you day.
I pray for disarmament. You know it's always us I don't turn to as a kind of I am but I'm
just saying that's with maybe the priest I wanted to be but we did I wanted to go.
Didn't get a chance to I tell you went to
jail just to sit and talk with inmates and say Look change it all I you
know I don't put too much religion on I said change your life reach out to God and I said I
don't I did and and then I and I was a pretty good leader and a basically free
to bio precinct you know just
songs not tourist but no homeless to give to charity to help all people who
don't and I should but I didn't know a lady would talk about the who was debacle.
So please if I come back I said as you. You know I said I want for most everything I want for miles
every day.
And I don't exercise every day I'm going to exercise and one and I says.
And a lady
I just looked at the lady was a possible good enough. I thought about what I have the money
and here I should tell the lady to come to my house I said I can one back I
just tell you so so Lady fine came to my house my wife we are sorry lady came to
my house and the lady would come I was seen as
I was a torrential downpour. My wife got soaked Clady got
soaked but she got to the house. I told her she says
you know what to do is what you do and I said to him. She said just very nice to you
and we will for the launch we offer
the no to what happened. She said what happened I was going to the stores I bought.
I bought a big hit it very day and I got to the library to go arrest all
the big down there and then I put all the babies up but I forgot that
one and I said take your money for forty hours a day with us not just an inch or
so we took it and
then another sad story when I was a lot of good deeds and I
didn't when I first was one time a Holmes guy.
I was trying to help out all the time and one time I had I got extra money actually I
said Bob He was a veteran here and he said to dispute his wife new to strictly street.

He said at one table I said it was. Lazy. I
created but then he walked out and then only Comeau Can you see Joe was
a nice Dean you did but don't do it again I said way he should be my question was could use most
of it.
So sometimes you try to do good and another time. That was in my
car I said Yes in ninety seven and another time I was I was at the Port
Authority I was at support of the free and already been ninety years old she was
trying to put on the underwear
again and I said Do you know God will help and in a black eye pondering
about it how long have I been praying on always.
A meal I was just an attorney and I was assistant one machine
company. I had three hundred dollars in my pocket and I was going out to dinner but I saw the old lady I
try to help her and how long have I been prairie and all ladies. You

have thought I'd got married. But again being young and.
I got married couple times and I was married once and I don't aggressively green you know.
I messed up and out
of town and a big mistake and I. But.
To do I believe is that you know
that I made every effort to return it to a mistake I made every effort to return and make
amends to my weight and
wanted people to do I feel bad about I said
no because I repeat. Because I believe in like reconciliation to go to
the fishing and I confess that oh god so sorry I made a mistake. I did I
made every effort to be true knows of some stake on my part and that it's time I've
gotten by with drugs and sorted into houses.
I mean I met a girl she worked for. She worked on
youngish Kowloon
again. She's a secretary for calling again and when I when I. When I met
her she told me why I want to be like a group in
the fifty's or soon was black

was afraid it was my call to do try to go but I went back and they had to beat me like a sugar
bowl or cocaine. And I tried it and and
I want Richman to and and and and then and as time at the time I found God.
And I maybe.
I messed up. I want some top man to go man just a form of How To cause to wear.
But again I guess. I did I did but again not to
go through books off my
show but I was kind of guy who will G. diamond rings or one
hundred thousand dollars in my pocket and I go oh my gosh I'm going boss and I go try
to call or talk to me so I don't talk to me sure why not this you know I have an appointment. You know this kind of
guy was I always would I mean French calls
and I would have passed because I was knowledge in my pocket and I
wanna do what I want no I did but then
I bought it and I'm glad I blow
it we don't know if it didn't happen to me
I was still doing all the same things really a deal is making money you can do
just like but I'm happy every day.
And when I found a very dirty seven having done it I was
your family
religion biodata I've gone out on a mountain and I said he even like I said
that I got my life and that my life I want to go back and request. I went
to the girls but I said and then it
hit and then she had two sisters it. Don't give me a chance to do it again. But
I don't know I was fifteen years celibate. I didn't go away and and everybody
when I went to God may move one you'll go dance for me and I tell the go
to dance you because you
might. I don't know if you don't know how to dance like a lady she skipped an exams or
some girl I have a hard time I carry a
bible to go out and it's I want to show you night
bible five hundred times when you push me a lot to me I'm going to said that in the Bible.
I'm going to love to you. And you have to cut off in the church in the church on time.
But again mention that and your church home
and I'm sure you want to do I so much to the game to getting to get into a zone to play a
series and then to have wine and cheese and it was going
alone and in fact.
I go I should but Nick and I had all I
like and I'm the guy you turned on night or should I go tonight a night of early.
Years and because you're trying to do
that for no no no just just just because I think guessing that you guys doing on it was
a relationship for your marriage. I would have relationships I was married I married
again
now I know I've been issued under Scripture and in my life in the church. No I've looked into church
or church secretary as usual to teach about living good church I work
for a religion to kids in school and then she called
me for drugs. I mean I was always going to
church or judge will push you know to a put air condition.
According to Josh. But air conditioning on the move clinic voters and so I did show snow
from everything I did wish I were going to church and then also there's a job
and and. I had to work seventy hours a day so tight sometimes driving
can work up many times. Scruton situs wrestling
on a Sunday and I separate B.C. I'm going to vote their jersey and I have to win the why don't
the snow in A.Z. sure snow in the car when you hosed the wind and
I have a guest like Miss I don't know guessed it vacant the window to stay awake
but you know at the center you know you push a horse too much.
So that said you know I was driving but I just did without a do
it trying to survive guy got me through a new I did
you did you get it right is that you already know how I learned to drive.
I picked you up as you were lose your downtown book and I said How do you go down
here and show us how I don't know the byways Well try your bill I don't know any
way that when I first started I know basic in your book and I get to not
hear what people tell me neighbors in several years ago I don't want to go to
Kennedy Why do you usually go sure. I'm sure you are no acquittal
I don't try your way tonight you know what I mean I don't even know you do what I had to do
you know that I knew that I was trying to be fair and honest
and as you do a lot of Joshua pre-political me I say tickle me that shapes joke. I
want to go to Pennsylvania. Do you have. As you
know he has you do all the moving man movement
Kansas eight hundred eight hundred nine hundred pasta truck. So I always was
fair to the people my son said
it was to feel it was sometimes a people to get ready one day a lady called
me. I said if your for be for nothing if you if you have
no money. I try to find out now if you fifteen to people have money.
I will literally a seven figure age which put on a vision I said but you better call a moving man
file
nomos So if you do a show in the car. Floods the basement also something which I think event.
Try to help the people. He actually shows. He
would three dollars I shows
are as good as you can shovel and will buy me a coffee occasionally
I always try to be fair with the people and I tell you every
day every day my re not ised version us into a charity every day for
the Jewish part is to have the edge through discernment and I said which
I would go to church to candle. I don't need to support us anyway I
see an issue. I don't go I see a homeless guy don't use
your eyes you can just say. And if you don't know like twenty or thirty.
As they could do something. But but they actually need. You but I just don't go and get to
the
cup but if people actually. Or something I've been on many lines like I see
an old lady and as a
Miss you don't have enough money. I said yes she does but I want to have a meal. I
said yes she does I had the difference in astronomy
as I told
it as a kind of guy but.
Oh sure I do I do hope the underdog and.
Judge me address guys who do you write letters to my wife has
a job. And how to get what I was tested
I did some and and when I was a job something happens
you have to
me Your give us sixty seventy dozen dollars and what I have left
you. And me when you sit down have to begin.
To say my debt to my boys see my dads in a better
place with is no more pain does no more Salo does no Marge good.
He's happy. So he don't want to be said he enjoyed
my wiped away no black usually laugh about my dad she meant my dad
always kids yet it is number one rule is what your mother made needle for Measure
did he always say. What you want but remember
you will eat every day you take some time I could use a vision.
That was a fish supper five my mother's where I could read it all. And I was a
lazy ation so he knew he didn't need reading carriages retainers and my mother
going home which always finished and then after it was tried to from oh my mother's mother
stopped pushing you know but I never let my kids lose
and I said and what I when I die you know me I'll turn over in my grave.
So any you eat at each East each day. Whatever you do I'd eat but make sure you
don't look to take it out with to a dog or to another. But don't leave it.
And I don't I don't need all my eyes in my eyes and all
this is a. I just good thing we were sixty five years so I hope
it helps somebody else and I don't need all my obvious to two
people to songs which I do like doing that I'm going to question.
And I tell you I've passed a budget where. I don't tell us to act rationally.
But I just. But the intention my sense is that's a stupid thing to do
it didn't get that boot. I said but jeez is five
thousand people but if you're fishing if you read a story in the Bible.
So I'm sure he's a miracle that I'm sure when I see it when I put in as I pray when
I don't just do it to to do it as I do is a shape over to my plate my
my attention is I hope that the pool day will find some pork in the
world
maybe you could see that isn't as my my God on issues
of
where it's at in my head just like a priest only one time as a father and when I
sell drugs the old has a liquor store. Joe to worry about that shit
when you get the two dollars you know leave you can't you can tell the cops
who and who also
know you gave it a good intention. Every descent with a bad intention. Your Hands
know about it so I always do when I go I know what to do it till my drug judge knows I
gave I gave it a good eleven intention of going to church
new videos I went to when I
was when I was up to no good and one time I saw the city actually like fuck Well
an apostle who fired up the fire didn't one day go and a guy every day passed
by and he should not sending someone. This is minute a key he had
to play some I put money no time. And I see a big
little boy up. And I shoot a guy full name but some lesson Epicurean.
And getting a little.
Used to Sumit and you have watched people. Try to
give people mouth to mouth and meanwhile put in a pocket.
Do they die on the floor.
And it down that lead to helping me like that man is my partner trying to you
was you and I says I
know that I got an approval of a few of us are never any Sure.
When you voted to get off the good. You know I suppose
what have you all day tell you that anyway. It's only been broken by living
here about living in Brooklyn.
And
live in Brooklyn this is my best I was I guess is again given to Churchill
always doing good things in a.
Live in important mission. Its really
good spirited looking and I don't know if I had been in book and I think I have
been to hell and back. You know I says and I tell you my my my family
and I ten is seven years old and eight years old you want to defend yourself and
in this time when he comes forward and you
know this is a guest and did it I went to counseling and I was a wise
move for you great and denounce you maybe I do not have a.
But I didn't once did of what they do is write me very good discipline at home so they
can chill and then she's You see this is just an acknowledgment I press
down with my underwear she would have. If you hang out
hope to talk. But I was afraid to tell my
mother because my mother was a you disobey anon.
So I never told her so every day from for years as you know we do you have beaten which is actually going to
definitely get like that just like I am but it doesn't but if I was trying to give you the
discipline I have to give a shit idea she was going to discipline and I didn't get
home again and the last thing about governesses I love my work for the
church many years I
was I always was devoted all and I got you know the Catholic
celebrity kena time and I'll do that I'm here to give hundred ten
percent to
God church and I said I did a year and at one point when Tennyson a
priest a young priest to do. Cavender of a church even me I give
two dozen for the innovation he raised me in to do it but but then he always to me should
mistreat meat on the holidays I decorated for
Christmas and his volunteers and and us and a trough I said OK.
I said that preaches a lunch and then me I was God in it and him said See you
later Joe. And you get on Jeanette and then he
was there and the Opus was it goes makes you had a huge makes you had a meal
every
day and then he said Joe works hard as he could to produce one porch up
to you Should a priest don't do any I go to Joe do I maintain it and then when
Tommy came he said to me Joe there'd be no one wants for you. I don't wish
to assist. If you meet a church or do American for but now environment is very
nearly seven large.
So you should you know he wasn't fond of me he didn't like me and yet and then I was ten or parted on a few
no books
and eventually goes isn't as you go to the Julio's it loses. One of
A and then when he came when he was a big big PI who retired
recently and there's somebody come in to volunteer to say you know if you had to follow and said Joe don't
you count on you. So way everyone who time apart you how can you go at
your
question depresses invite me. And I guess I should have all
day and then sometimes kids come in for heart just answer the phone we were three hours I was all
day and he made me a new woman. How did I park my car they have like twenty years out of
my spot.
He was upon and
