00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So tell me a little bit so I made my

My

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And when I was

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
money and you were new cars new clothes he

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
decided that he wanted to go

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
mobile. My parents broke up my grandmother in

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that with me because they was eighteen years old they want to do what I was doing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that so we ended up and minute. Oh the poor I looked

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
at Minnesota I lived on duty in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the streets in Jackson

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Mississippi. Maku of the Pullman porter migration was

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in full going to Mississippi to California and going

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
from Mississippi to Chicago and going to the man that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Martha said he didn't want to live in Chicago so he took us to many happy.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Magnus's full man in the avenue

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
not. At the beginning to grow. My father say he wanted me in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
his mother near him. So this took us to Gary in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the best weather gear and then analyses for that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
was what I was a school.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Flava or piece of silk mill and he decided that this film those

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
he wanted

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to go to set up machine nationalists he didn't want to is he was born there.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He worked as a ship with the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
foundry on a ship out. That means when you put seal on a paid

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
leave that ship demoted back to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
loose and that means you can all burn up on that high

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
ad and if a man falls in the morning made in a car they mean

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to give us a day off maybe supposed to Scott. Wasn't doing enough but they

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
just supposed to just

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
fly. By the time I was

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
seventeen I got married

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and my husband what Chicago to get a job because the plants were going down and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
what's going on not so much.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I was made to use and I had my daughter my husband went to service but

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
on and came home. My daughter came

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
up and then we stayed in Chicago. We broke up so I decided

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to side grandfather had come here in one thousand nine hundred and my father's becoming periodic

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in New York. We moved to New York. Moved and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
underneath the street between minutes and seconds.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Later on I'm going back to school moved to the Bronx and then I went to school and I had high

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
school diploma which I didn't have before.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And I stopped working for

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the city of New York. They were very short of nurses and they gave a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.000
wide

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
test and the test said nobody could go to school it was same

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
time it was impossible. Because the work was a long study

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
hours. So Washington after we took the Ted came out on top

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and they call us the cream of the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
crop. So this inner man from Washington D.C..

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we met the bill be

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
auditory that in time. That would give us a kick

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
up a divided Hackler some of us went to the Bronx which I was living

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
there some state in

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Manhattan. After we graduated I was no television.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
As an answer then news. I didn't get a chance to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
see myself because by the time I came back into the newsroom all my mother came for the great.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Interation and I were for the Department of hospitals

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of nineteen sixty three.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Until I retired thirty one he is tatted fifty four with that had been the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
big question then to blame. They don't give me an extra money just leave if you want to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
so I've had people with that I've had that in the. Oh and by the way

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
when you graduated

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
this is a man back from Washington D.C. to see us graduate because they

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.000
said

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that it was a hardship and they send the money they have everybody was very happy that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.000
we

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
graduated because i'm said manpower had been given

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to people on welfare

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and people know if they didn't want to do this it was to get it checked out I gave

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the city the nationwide Ted.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
When asked the came out of school. Bedside was born

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to a beloved state they had a lot of

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
houses abandoned all the books and in fact houses or what about.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The neighbor he had paid two hundred fifty to his house in fact he still does over.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Happen though. I met his family and I told

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
him I said gee I'd like to get money so I went back and got my car.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
About someone else and I walked the street and I found a house to sixty five

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
friends up for your house break.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Washington D.C. was asking for two thousand dollars for.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.000
My

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
boys but now we offer two thousand

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
five hundred one of the cages and call back and say you got it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So then they have a lot next door was going for fifty dollars at another and I

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
don't want to buy what I can choose

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because they give you the house as it

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is you have to fix

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
up. To the. I was to my left

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
house and some of the fifty

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
dogs may have

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
gone and I think the house next door might have been a hundred

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
or so leave the lavatory the property

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
was a fool of herself but nobody wanted to buy. That's why ought to have been the stock

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
of people who knew how to quit because most people

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I guess were crazy did not

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
fix. Those houses

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
have gotten

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
rich all through that had put back into

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
place those one is a so large

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and Samantha stand in the winter and have room in the casket to come

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
through they would still

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
be got to put Windows

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
when we got to group

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
immunity Gaskin put on new premises by the side of the computers and. The whole house was a few

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
minutes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Then I decided to come over here to live in New York.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I had wanted a new home out of used to being in the West where you had to live.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And kitchen and I used to kitchen it. Our lives we didn't have kids and

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
then we have my house you have a backyard sweat you up and when I came to New York. I

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
was shocked to see people on a dog in the

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
street because we do that they do you have a dog a way to

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
go and check it out and I told my friends about it we came of them want to have

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to work and

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I was supposed to be

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
exact and they had one we like and fallen out of the hole. To another house

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
in moved to a one one house had two bedrooms another

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
room other the house at three. So I've been as I have

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
come in from out of town. I wanted that we needed give me this what I took some of the seven thousand in there

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
because of the spiritual.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And the I had you had to pay one hundred dollars down. That's a picture name on the list.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So I paid one hundred dollars. And when I was doing is five

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
years abandoning each year for the news now and.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So I ask nothing can snap out of this and that's gone on T.V. I don't know what it

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
was so I decide to call it what number are you up to and after

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that number is pretty close to man.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And sure enough when I was going to Calif one of the ridges they usually

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
use misuses now as when I'm going to California as in I can't get the papers together.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Herman put my name. When I come back I'm giving the place in the TO

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
THE So Sheridan. I took all the documents in.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And they called me for the fifth of October.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I moved into my brand new house. Since about

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
two and I was so

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
happy she you imagine her brand new

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
cars placard that I had bought property of the Channel

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
eleven out of the land Sid out to Maison

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
landed it is a suburb of mine which is a beautiful city

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
subject and I had saved my money and apertures I still went down there I ate the lamb with

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
it that was supposed to my wood time

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
now. But it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
The kind of wood down. People didn't have jobs so I

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
decided that I would retire from New York

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
City and I Gap's what blast so Mt with jack crap about

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because you want to give up a house. Eighty's or the land and the hell

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and the whole

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
con My name is on seventeen of the sun has twenty four and

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that neighborhood than a school

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
it's so I think there's a difference I've retired from the

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
private hospitals. I'm going to New York I'm not going to believe this is because

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
less than.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
OK. That's so interesting how would

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000
you

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
describe

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
this year to you your daughter grew up in

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
your mind. It was born in Chicago and came here when

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
she was too.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
She stayed in New York till she was thirteen and that's when I bought my

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
house and could have you know that Kommersant is used to having the marketing

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.000
been agreed

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
upon what it was a commercial you know but that

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Kommersant was some

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
hope with high school in New Jersey. That's where she went to school and

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
then when she came out of who she wanted a burger.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
She went to Little Falls New Jersey going to come to visit business because when

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
it comes to the of the trainee they have to practice because you know. So people who

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
don't know the city of them know very bitter because the of the

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Berkeley downtown in Manhattan but she can show the new falls Missouri and she

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
began executive

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
secretary. And good as

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
the bank moved out to

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
New Jersey all

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
quarters all those need to know and that money money

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
money all the socketed so she went to school that day she

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
came down Wall Street to work and when you know I would have to have lunch

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
with she is almost seventy four so me don't even

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
go you don't even see that in the

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
back and when those girls get a job they tell them how to pick

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the window when to keep to will you to the job and they have a code that

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
these and that the lady doesn't take the job the agency called them

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
back and ask them how many windows. Did you take the job because if you don't think the

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
job is in you some places they don't have to look for jobs. Very good job to the

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
other and no that's why those who's going

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
to be chosen to have my daughter met

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
her on Wall Street. He's up.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
He is the one who read the paper work for banks when the

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
merge How would you cough but that's what he does is an acquisition. How

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
will he put the paperwork for the bank when he gets to merge with another and he.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Connected to college so they are behind Rector's. And her neighbors

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
are professors that represent versus They live

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
in

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Scouting New Jersey and their grandson has raised others. In

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
fact he graduated it about in their careers were babies coming out of a new

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
city and they were raised. Let's with some babies up

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
because they were brought there when they were three months so and

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
then after they began to

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
walk and look around. Everybody comes the baby to their base to walk to the principal's

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
office and keep the principal with them to have and then they will beg picture to be walking

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
around so they graduated with the Seton Hall he wouldn't finish

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
on the line with him but the sent him to

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
see Hollywood go. So all those kids' college

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
educated is no bums who

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
are those people have money in the well S.S. They don't even have the outfit

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
we don't have a come

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
out after having come back in a year know how to get back and

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
then you come back to a certain way and they have people who

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
have both parts I have a house and a diesel back they have water called back

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
in it or just on what you said to him.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So they have a lot of changes over there but

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
little question. They are not the middle of the meal

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
people and he can meet every day from lasted to New York City downtown in the forty's.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So I always told him. Do

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
it because you came in don't get with a whole meal here. We did a marathon in those we

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
did after the but is over

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the N.G.'s because it was all need come abroad to New York City to the next

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
the know how much.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
They are needing one too. They know how much it was. Because

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
you got the Peterson family.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So in a way I got that mirror of them whether they have or they may need is back to.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
To hurry. She's now my daughter's fiftieth were she to decide to act on the six.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And I have a daughter that was

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
from Africa. I went to Ghana and more and I

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
brought her to

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
America and brought three Q To all of them of the college they

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
finished. As.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So I have a daughter that I call my daughter who's sixty six to Barack of our

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
daughter this you know my daughter but after her from

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
combusted West Africa. Her mother is not a WOW WHERE I'M

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
A Now the woman in

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Africa when the white man came to us to pay to go to students here.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
They were killed in the blackness so fast to get the Goes to justice a God

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
they will not go to and is no record nobody made it sound as though they bring

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
to hell with

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
it and they were there to take the ghost is a little taken from his chances and see God

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
critters now and they will kill the men so fast the men got can fly because they're primitive

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
weapons and so was a little taken while I'm

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
alive and they hear it in the media and

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
she's ninety no

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
one who took her son who was taken a son incidentally America they don't know who it

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
is and but they could plan but that's

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
considered last month or is a grand tour now and they put it in a

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
children's book. They write about why not choose

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
bachata if she was to do you suppose she was left

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
open Jr made out of

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
blue and she said they could see them all it took at

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
judo so you could observe her and she died in nineteen

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
or so where mother of African kid. Some

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
guy to go cause people moment they changed the name but it was a

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
big

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
locos so I've been around. Wrong

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Paris went to the good news when I was out of the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
better. As one than all of

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that were issued to come to

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
your New York as the best people to die.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Went to Paris Paris is a joke joke and put

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
enough tomato sauce

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
in were.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
That's a chip butty. Pizza but when

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
you Bill Gates but I mean you know Plymouth to get it in there EVER this

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
is not

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
enough and I wonder how little they really have the work to a person die and

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
they pay yours and me three needs how little

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I knew of another nap and I'm going

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
to a street in November December.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I'm going to Johannesburg where I went to Mandela's first house.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I had to Desmond Tutu. I went to Mandela's

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
White House. And I went on

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
safari first and I enjoyed it but we wanted

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
a group of the Lions could come up to the car park. They have separated by

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
water and when you see them do good zebras trees to see

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
if there's a lot of oh they don't want the U.K. see below but I'm going

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
with so they actually don't bring in potato chips.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Fredo the anything back there because there was no this mother they made up so they

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
actually don't back the witty lead by the don't bring it because they have you

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
know big

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
bucks but they don't tell you please don't buy because they know what it is. And they

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
found

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
go to the woman after the year two thousand and

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
twenty and all that go goes

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
to Jared. Africa doesn't need it.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.000
They

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
did platinum I never saw the down the hotel there

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Gaiman Africa is a rich. But it's poor because

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
of the second address and they don't talk about it that's why I don't think any money to

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Africa because

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
it did get rid of the people that are here the ever better have no money

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
to poor poor because they've been sucked dry because I have to muster what it might so that what they did

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
in the mines. That's

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
what can you imagine if they didn't dance and us into

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Hell that's the part that they did.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Again list so

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
legend. Do you

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
think the

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
most important change. You see your time your

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
dues and knew you were for anywhere in Europe

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
especially. What I was giving the impression

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
that I

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
love New York have too many opportunities for

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
you if you don't get hooked on drugs because the I didn't know how

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
my hair

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
was James says Nicky but I

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
was nowhere in his power and.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I was didn't

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
want to work at Mt Sinai before I went to work for the city.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I have good union and. I want

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
to get it in and then I left and went to work for the city because I'm

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
outside and have a union at the time and

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
in good doing three giving if it is out we. That would use our

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
time now to work with the city whose game unit. Won eleven every two years with

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
a great winning line up so.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
If you could just keep our own crowd.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Of people you can make it but if you two would people who down the Dream Team

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
and and everything else you just can't grasp because when I came

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
out of nurses school.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
We all know all the nurses were two jobs I was working one job.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
That I was able to raise my family

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
out of

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
how. Go to the pamphlet had bigger

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
names for the standard

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
kitchenette and then. For probably going to move

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
out move a lot of the house into

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
a neighborhood where she could see that everybody was

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
heading out of the one hundred

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
eighty that was my

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
because I was a grandmother who didn't know her A.B.C..

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And ABLE TO SCHOOL I had nobody help me I had to go to the

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
needs an hour

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and I

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
did and I'm tired of most of about

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
it and I don't take the stuff up in about an hour

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
and we're going to do it all kind of Marxism in

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
because I want people to process what color green

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
purple just make it with little kids get up and make a living

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
but something the spirit had when you spirit that you

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
did and you have

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
to teach a kid.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
On how you got to learn it she taught

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
me

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
to law. I see you don't want to learn. She said No I left a

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
long year later that came back and they were about half an answer

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
what do you have somebody you know that I was black to you would she say your daughter just graduated out

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
of school.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I see

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
what the same over to me that she didn't want to learn it. She only two years

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
that they got out of college and this of them in the family

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
will probably not only don't know about a new one Oh you mean

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
is she still an ongoing process to have that only one of

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
the cows

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
again this is she see this

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
is she to come out the same so when I succeed and I say don't

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
be asked in the money. If you want them come with me as a

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
lad and I am so

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
proud to the injury she took of them

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
if you have a problem.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And that's not much

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
it. And

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
my kids and kids in this illness and some of

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
the kids. And

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
they were just as

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
good and I'm a girl on

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
a historic asked what was that I don't know she said you will know the

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
class and he said I didn't know that you knew that

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
much because I am a blow to chance want to work

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
because latitude don't know the air is a noun hammer a country to govern to tell people that we're

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
that we're all in the UK I'm seriously I'm

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
an alien you are

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
too. So how did doesn't want to keep you

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
stupid they can see that

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
you were

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
told that we keep Sirius B. is a look this is what we can know the

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
thing they found it found here is

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
B. they found a little have the banding but about

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
it and they alter They came of the sky and with the same in the sky

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
people in the hopes a blue sky people.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And they will say

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
to

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
you and

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I wouldn't be

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
surprised what the how what sounds.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
OK now what is the very thing that we have

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
uncovered.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000

The elevator in the house and they had

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
way I have family

actually

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
from some

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
of the cars and they sit on the base as opposed

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
to take a trip back

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
to lost causes

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
nothing but walk through

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
so they and they have to to I'm not

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
the one with a

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
backpack things further out over got to

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
walk in the park and the

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
numbers further

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
out so she stays opponent to motivate the

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
controller sounds just go. She's awful news. And

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
she grunted and then

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
looked and saw that come back most

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
straight. Maybe people. That's

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
not Rockefeller lost

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
more but when I come back to their homes.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Because

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
anytime. So my life that I've been telling her particularly when I'm you got

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
me. And that's why I've given them accountable

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
to catch up and it's you know I don't want to go to the

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
holding not

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
of their ideas on making a

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
success but I always want to meet Castro.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Uber refreezing.
