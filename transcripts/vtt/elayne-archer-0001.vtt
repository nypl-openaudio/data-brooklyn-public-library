00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is par for the Brooklyn public library are our stories

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
project and here our

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
local library lady Archer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
With a for her in a way

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
where well I was born in London but my father was

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
killed in the second world war. You know how old I am and I was brought to Canada I was raised

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in Canada. Not a typical childhood spent some time in foster

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
homes which I think perhaps

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
made me more ready to live communally in a way and then came to scald country to go to the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
university and then move to New York for graduate school. And then we moved to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Brooklyn to live in a commune.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm going to go on forever. The main This was the very beginning of the women's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
movement and we call it the Women's Liberation Movement the word

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
feminist has not yet been mentioned and mainly unlike

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
today and it's really hard to imagine men took no role in

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
childcare whatsoever in those days

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
even kind in Latin men so the main force in the commune

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
with to get men to get to share

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
childcare so that other women could help you raise your children

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and men would do their share so originally to families.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
My my my ex-husband and I and a friend and her husband. We

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
had to find we couldn't afford to do it we had to find another family which we did.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So there were six adults and five children who bought a house on sixth

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Street to family house originally built as a two family house that was extra wide

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and long it was quite big for a Brooklyn house.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
People now are amazed that it cost seventy five thousand dollars but that was a lot of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
money you could only get Brooklyn was redlined.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You could only get a forty thousand dollars mortgage. So we had to come up with twenty thousand dollars

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and would borrow some money and we were. It was very very hard

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
financially but we moved in one nine hundred seventy two Christmas one nine hundred seventy two

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and we lived together for thirteen

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
years as a calling you.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Mean I could just keep talking or you could ask me some question. Well the I Have I want to say

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
right from the beginning everybody always says oh you know sex there was it was just agreed right from

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the beginning the no sex no really we didn't read Marx

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
together we were all very

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
leftist and we all pretty much agree we were going to get no more we

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
were working in civil rights and women's health issues. And we

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
just agreed and we were just sort of new we sort of agreed about the raising of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
children you know not too strict but

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
not not to. You

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
know we we had very much high standards for the children they participated they set the table

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and everything the biggest challenge in the Conran were was

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
setting up a schedule and the schedule involved

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
childcare making dinner doing the shopping and doing

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
other household tasks and getting that together. Everybody had to

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
be somewhat flexible in their work.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It's not always possible.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But two of us were teachers at the college level so we could usually have one day off.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And you really you ended up cooking only one day a week so we ate incredibly

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
well because somebody cooked a big meal one day a week for twelve people.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We were very involved and we had a house a big house with about. Let's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
see twelve. Six bedrooms in the two unit. So

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
every in a way and funny when people have more privacy when we live communally than they did

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
when we then broke up the commune because we shared living space that's all we

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
shared and then every couple had two rooms. Bedroom study

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
two bedrooms depending on their work hours and the children

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.000
shared

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
about five children shared three

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
rooms and probably the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
biggest issue was decorating the place.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Because that was so unnecessary you know we we were never disagreed about we

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
had to pay the mortgage we pay the taxes we fix the roof when it leaked we had a very we have a lot

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of maintenance issues but my ex-husband was very handy so he did a lot of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that to this day I am close

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
to the two other families. I have a huge extended family

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and they all live in Brooklyn and I don't have any grandchildren of my own but I'm sort of like a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
grandmother great aunt to about seven my

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
community or grandchildren and a sort of an

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
answer to for how many for five children

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
so it's been it's been fabulous in that way.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
When asked if I could keep going on but I feel like I'm so.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well one of the women two of us were actually English.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So I met after college and went to live in England for a year with

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
my grandmother and then I met a woman who it was very we

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
were sort of a modern early women stuff that's what we were involved with that was the major We

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
were involved in women's health issues in New York City especially because we saw that women's health

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.000
was an

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
issue that really

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
did concern all women. So even if we were mostly

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
middle class women which was the criticism that was often leveled that the women's

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
movement at that time health was something that everybody needed help on

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
getting access to child care to birth control and to

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
abortion although now we have to call that choice but

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we were very active around. And outlaw the New York state

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
abortion laws which were you couldn't get a legal abortion in New York State in the in

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
the sixty's we all had children. That was the other thing we were all

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
struggling for child care. We couldn't.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Firstly there were no daycare centers to speak

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
of and we couldn't and didn't want to afford a nanny only very very

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
very rich people had

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
nannies and so we were constantly juggling we had

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
childcare groups babysitting groups are you gay people

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
like token his and then you know they all just for hours you wore them for hours and that's how

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I raised my children my son for the first couple of years because my ex-husband was

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
working full time you know there were very few options and a big prejudice against

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
women who were it was very very

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
different and so that was the main thing that we had to work go

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
to how we could raise our children with more

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
help from the man and with help from each other we also thought and I was a

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
young mother I'd never had any. I'd never been raised with other

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
children. I was happy to have other

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
people help me raise my children. I think more the attitude

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
today is I'm the one taking care of my children we were I was thrilled to

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
have other people raise my children with me and see how they did it and what they did.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And I think the only issue really in the end was space because

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
one marriage broke out and. That woman got together with another guy

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
who had two children and we have room for. I would have

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
a children for

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that so they eventually that family moved out moved up the street

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
we made we still remain very close to them and did a lot of things together and then two

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
families lived together

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
communally for the next seven years and even we broke up the commune and they moved up stairs.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
We put it back to the two family house at. Always was we had

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
meetings we had we really had no political disagreements there were some times

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
when we felt one child or another needed a little discipline and

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that was an issue.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Are real issues I never criticize what people did

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
their children and what I thought was really serious but it never was that serious.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So I think that we were just.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We we all

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
agreed. To respect each other's privacy as much as

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
possible you know for the Sunday morning and people reading the times you didn't talk to them.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
or you went up to your room to read the Times you know. We

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
paid the financial issues were really amazingly not an issue. We

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
each paid. The same amount every month. Even though there was slight

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
variation in family size to adult. You know and. It was so much less.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I mean I think was five hundred dollars a month. We paid which

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
covered all the house expenses the mortgage along with the taxes the insurance all

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the food and of course all the

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
childcare. Even for then that was a little amount of money to spend

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
so even though we were hard

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
pressed and there were constant meet Nathan's issues we somehow managed to never

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
have major issues of money which was pretty amazing really and the

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
only issues we had really as I said were the aesthetic issues of what to put

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
on the walls.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And occasionally a bit of difference

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
around. Well again how much you should spend for a rug for the living room

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
so that sort of thing is to sort of cheat a little bit put in some of my own

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
money so and it was just and but it was also a very different time

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because we were very

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
involved in the block. So we helped organize block parties we were

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
very organized in the P.T.A.. And we're very organized in sort of

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
we had baseball games in Prospect Park it was a different

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
time you know we saw organizing we saw block

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
parties as ways of sort of community outreach a lot of lovely

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
young people on my block today but when they give a block party.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It's just

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
for the ten people who decide to give it you know they don't put flyers in the

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
apartment buildings and there's a bit of a owner renter divide now has

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
happened on the block which really didn't exist in the past. I mean they. I don't think

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
it did exist because none of us

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
were even those of us who lived in houses were not obviously wealthy.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Whereas now today the people who live by the new houses and they're really wealthy.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So it was a it was a different time and I think then we didn't think communal living

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
was so unusual that it made sense to share

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
childcare.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Well. You know now that I think about it not as many I've heard of I knew of one other family.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I knew about two

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
more and I knew of somewhere there were no children.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You know it was just for adults more like what you have today with flat sharing.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
But this was really done with a.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I suppose with a political agenda that it was preferable

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to living alone and there was some notion of

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
monogamy was not didn't. Wasn't really for the human condition that

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
people should be able to have this would allow people. I mean a cynical

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
view there's a good deal of the Commune which would be that since it was Jewish Jews

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and Christians in it that the commune allowed some people to celebrate

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Christmas and some guys to have affairs if I do have to put it

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that way because that did happen and to put it we did put a strain and eventually

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
my relationship with my husband broke

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
up. Sort of a nickel Blee in the end

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
because it didn't leave us as desperate because there

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I was living in this

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
house which in fact a tiny bit of money from

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
my grandmother had allowed me

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
to I sort of own the house more than my ex-husband so that made it but he'd done.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Alison's of dollars of work on it but he you know just said I have no claim to the

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
house and moved two blocks away and we get along just fine and so it was good but

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.000
it did mean

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that I wasn't sort

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
of desperate. When my husband ex-husband and I broke up

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and sometimes I see the young women today who've stopped working to raise their children.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I do understand that but I also think

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
while a lot of marriages end up in divorce and what you're going to do if you have no

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
foot in the.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
In the workplace. Apart from your identity issues and earning your own money.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It really I

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
think. We just had a buffer for the kids and I think they would all agree.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I mean they would

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
criticize sometimes and you hear them talk about how we were poor so we had

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
margarine not butter in the days when we thought margarine and really nice

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
kids go on about that again. Wow Get a life on

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
the whole

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
really we were pretty much all committed to making it work and I think that's

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
what made it work. We saw in it but it paid off such big

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
time you know you'd leave for work in the morning. Your good friend Alice or

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Rachel with you holding your kid and waving to you from the window and maybe the kid would cry for

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
one minute but them are off off and running playing there was like a a daycare

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
center in the

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
house and basement that was great to play

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
in I think all the kids would say was a great way to grow

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
up but I think it's hard to live as young women because I've been fond of

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
my grandchildren that I meet in playgrounds. Why. You do this and one

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
of the answers is financial that the pricing housing prices are so

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
great that in order to buy a

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
house you need to have a rental unit that you can charge some

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
outlandish amount of money

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
for in order to pay the mortgage but I also think it's more of a it's

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
also a psychological thing

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
or there's a lot of pressure on young parents

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
today and especially young women to be like perfect mothers.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I think we all knew we were perfect

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
mothers and that we could balance that by someone else.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
You know having another person there

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
to take over a meal was also if your kid was sick.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You didn't always have to miss

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
work. If you weren't on there's a famous story about a little boy who came down

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the one who was a bit. Sometimes difficult.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
My English friend was very

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
strict you know if you wanted something at the dinner table you said Rachel

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
could you please pass the butter you didn't reach and just grab it or you didn't take

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
the muffin E. half of it and put it back that manners but

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I said. So this little boy came down one day

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and he was just dressed like she was were tired and is here you know

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
whatever and instead of saying to his

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
mother Mom you know I need your money to help me he said to her she was rushing up to

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
her who was on today by which she meant to

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
which adult should I go to have the time i Shares and I thought that was really

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
great my friend feels guilty but that is another great we recognize that one of us was

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
there and our job was if you were on a tremendous amount of work you got up

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
early you made breakfast

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
for eleven people September first but they had great

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
practice you know every day something different you got the kids to

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
school unless one of the working adults said OK I'll drop them off at three

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
twenty

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
one you pick them up for lunch.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And brought them home and took them back to pick them up after school you made dinner was a lot

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
of work.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
You didn't do the clean up. Maybe you did do the clean up it was a huge day of

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
work but then you were off the rest of the week even though you were often around and

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.000
don't want

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
to I was often around because I was a teacher I was upstairs grading papers. So there was

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
often somebody else at home to do backa it wasn't like one person. The kid only saw

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the parent one day a week it wasn't like that at all and we all put our own kids

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
to bed pretty

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
much unless we were late but we were there for them a huge amount.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
But we also you know the older kids read to the younger

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
kids Lego was a huge thing that was like a sea of Lego see a Lego.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And it was the old Lego didn't it didn't come in sets so you built your own

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.000
you know you

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
didn't. It wasn't like oh this is Star Trek build your starship it was

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
just build whatever you want to build it was very imaginative and that we had huge color and we had

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
shoes art supplies and then it was a fabulous way to grow

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
up and that was his basement which in those days didn't get wet we weren't getting the storms

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
we get now and they had a whole other world down there. That's what many of them would remember

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
the total privacy of the basement. Because they were left.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I mean you left the door open. You could hear that they were OK but in the basement they

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
were in their own

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
world and that was really. And then you know we had great

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
celebrations Christmas especially Thanksgiving very festive times I mean it's much nicer to come

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
down to a Christmas tree with.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Sixty presents under it even though it only it only adds up to four or five presents a person

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
but because there were so many people it was very festive I think that's been an adjustment for some of them

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
they're living with their spouse and one child and there's only two to presents passing

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
over so anyway it broke up in one nine hundred eighty five

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
because two of the children were off to college and.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
One of the couples really

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
wanted not so much more privacy but they wanted to be able to have more friends stay

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
over and so they had to separate you know as I said just putting the house it

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
didn't cost much money just put the house back into the two family house it had always

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
been they just report the kitchen and it was the kitchen we hadn't

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
totally taken out the pipes or anything you know.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
So it was and then we continued to

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
live still quite cooperatively in terms of all

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
sorts of things in sharing like tricity and heat and wire and everything like that I mean

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I always said you couldn't live like this if you weren't willing to be generous about all

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
of the bills and everything had

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
to agree that whatever. Anyway so you can ask me something I'll

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
be happy.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yes.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Well I went to when I was eighteen graduating high school in Toronto my brother was

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
going back to London to go to drama school and my

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
mother was clear was saying that she was going to go back to London although she did

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
stay in Toronto until she retired but

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I applied to university I went

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
to I went to Raghav College Cambridge Massachusetts and

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I'm on a total scholarship I have to say and then

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I sort of had to decide was I going to go back to Toronto but I

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
wasn't Canadian I hadn't become a

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Canadian so I applied to I got into Columbia graduate school I

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
just came to New York City English with an English major

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
and those were the days of

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I I feel very badly for young people today I got my

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
whole education

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
to. Excellent school for Bourke virtually a thousand dollars.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I got total scholarships. Which when I was an

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
undergraduate was totally because my mother was a widow. And it wasn't working that time she was very sick.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
But in high in college it was just you did well enough you got some fellowship.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
They paid for everything and gave you

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
money but some believe. So I

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
had no college debt which is something I think real privilege.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
A privilege and I you

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
know we made that the goal I mean actually living this way in

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
the community and then even sharing a house we know our

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
co-op was a very thrifty way to live and we sort

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
of decided that one of our goals would be to help our

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
kids go to college debt free because it was a

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
bird with a bird's eye but I also

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
think because I didn't grow up

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
with a perfect mother because she was always working

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
and we were in foster homes my brother and me and we were boarding school. I didn't

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
have incredible standards of what kind of mother I should be

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
at some point I decided to learn to make chocolate chip cookies because although I hate chocolate

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
because I thought this was the American mom thing we had to make chocolate chip cookies

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
and I apparently make very good ones which I have never ever had

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
one never tasted one of my chocolate chip cookies but so you know and we.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I just didn't have those high standards. And a

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
very

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
occasionally when my son or my daughter would guilt trip me a little bit I would

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
think you have both parents. You have all sorts of other people involved you

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
know get a life. You're very lucky. So I wasn't quite

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
like I mean friends or my ex-husband and I broke up and it was quite in the couple and

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
he lived not very far away and we had a rule of thumb if one of us can go to

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the soccer game.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That's fine you don't need both parents at the soccer game the other person could be having spending some time

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
alone and they think. That we didn't spoil the kids in that

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
way but we chipped them

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
lots of attention to say the least it's funny I have had a lot of thoughts about

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
my child and it wasn't that typical for a middle class person who ended up

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
middle class.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Because my brother died recently and I was going through a lot of

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
it but I just I think that in the end.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
I had a certain toughness to the world which was good because when I got to Harvard

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
and Radcliff I really needed it because I was faced with a real privilege.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I had never quite encountered that though not as much privileges.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
There were this many rich rich rich people in those days and people well.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
People didn't go in the kind of occasions they go on you know and they didn't fly all over the world

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
to ski and everything so even at Harvard I didn't know many there were very wealthy

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
people but I didn't you didn't have to know

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
them you know I didn't dominate in any way.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
So I just think that the and it was an exciting time the sixty's you know

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
very whenever people you know there's a lot of badmouthing of the sixty's

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
but everybody I know went through it with the ended up in some sort of

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
vaguely useful job. You know I don't know anybody who went into banking

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
we're going to stock. You know may keep being hedge fund is their role in social services

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
teaching justice was a good time.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Not to say this isn't a good time to I don't like it but I just think it was a very different time there was a

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
feeling of well there was the war to fight against. And as it turns out we

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
were right about the war it was

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
a disastrous war big

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
mistake terrible

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
policies in fact we were more right than we

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
knew anyway but Aracely

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
some think of that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Well

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
it's gotten much wealthier. I mean when we moved in people

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
almost it especially our block the

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
park blocks were always off. But still all the but all the houses were

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
rooming house and they were

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
all. And you wouldn't know it from looking at the brownstone facade some of them

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
still are actually but we have one two

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
three four five seven five small apartment blocks

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.000
so we always had

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
a mix of renters and people who lived there when we first moved

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
into the block the neighborhood was totally Irish Irish

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Catholic. And when we first moved into the block.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
There was some anti semitism. And I remember an incident

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
where I was lighting the menorah I was in Jewish but I was the one who Lipmann or with

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.000
the

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
kids and I heard someone scream Jews on sixty and

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I pushed the kids down because I half expected a rock through the

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
window. And the big Catholic Church across the street St

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Saviour's which has much improved but at no time it offered nothing in the way of services to

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
the communal childcare no summer camp. And they were some somewhat annoyed

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
at the hippies who were moving and you know living in a commune and we weren't the there were other people on

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
the street.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
You know who occasionally sat on their students smoking marijuana cigarette they

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
were. They were aware of the change but once it turned

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
out that we took care in once they saw that we were taking care of the place.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
But then it just became this and the school three twenty one was much

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
more in a strange way. More racially

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
nicks and more economically mixed because it was a Title one school because with a title

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
one school. There were something like three to

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
four G.. Got of free time every

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
day so they had

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
to provide when you do it the kids in that free time so my son had

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
music. All sorts of things that my daughter when she went to the school ten

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
years later never had because it wasn't for school anymore. So the P.T.A. had to fund

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
that wasn't provided so in some ways she got I thought a better

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
education in that way you can get a better education in terms of

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
the school has become so much more enlightened

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
about pedagogy. But the neighborhood has become

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
just much more well the more

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
people I would say less community

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
spirit more. I don't want to complain about the children of Park

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Slope but I think a lot of children are being raised to be not

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
as aware of others as our children were raised you

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
know don't bump into people you know apologized to people don't acknowledge

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
in restaurants just that sort of thing. I think that it is just a

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
different time.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
There are block parties and there are

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
social involved but I don't think people are as involved because

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
think even though we all worked and many women

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
were use of kids played on the street you could still let kids play on the street you know you

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
could even let your kids.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Well I don't know when we first let them go to Prospect Park. They could walk to school on their own that was no big

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
deal to see a group of kids walking to school and now you almost never do you see that

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
when you drive to the neighborhood.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
I remember once that last spring I was driving from a doctor you mean that was a beautiful early

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
spring day and I drove

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
through you know Bed Stuy in Brownsville and I saw these children playing on the

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
street hopscotch and closer I got to park slope in Park Slope there wasn't

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
a kid on the

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
street because they were all in fencing. And after school you know

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
the kids' time is much more programmed.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I mean I only my son took one after school activity and my daughter

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
took he came home we played on the street play stickball play. Then

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
my daughter took I think one class just I think it's

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
about children women working

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
more but also the ethos that children have to be

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
totally stimulated and given all these opportunities which I think

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
is contributing to the whole we talk a lot about the financial economic

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
equity divide but I think there's a huge divide between children the enrichment

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
of getting poor parents just can't

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
do I think it's very poor kids and.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
You know schools here the teachers were in grade one kindergarten would say there's no

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
problem teaching reading they don't know how to read.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Whereas I think in four schools that's a real

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
issue with the different time and I

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
think. The neighborhood was

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
once people used to tell me how their parents sold their house on Tenth Street to move to

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Staten

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Island. Now they wish they had a back. Because

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
it was their houses were run down and.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
What I found and I read about the neighborhood I think genes are really that

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
dangerous the Underground is a wreck.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
You know things have improved in New York and it was nowhere near as green.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I mean the park was kind

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
of still sick. Trying to survive what Robert

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Moses had done you know putting cemented everywhere and it was in very

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
very bad shape because they park alliance with me.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
So with any other.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
You know and I think

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
that just to say that I wish more people could think of doing it.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I think their lives would be a lot easier although there are always the pressures

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
of finding the right group of

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
people because actually once you think about it there's everybody could be annoying

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
to you but I think that's what we really rose above that level of

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
pettiness because we saw the greater

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
good world pretty much friends

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
today one of us is all right so

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I'm hoping to write it up I haven't written up so then I'll let you have

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
that right now thank you very much was

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
great great and I have to go home and start looking through files.
