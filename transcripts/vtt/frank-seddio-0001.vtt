00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. My name is Diane

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and library

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with a. And it for the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
AFI

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that I find great. I had.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Oh well. I want to first start by thanking you for giving me the privilege of being a part of such a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
wonderful idea and a great program as many many times and we do a lot of things that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
are recorded and not enough times

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that people realize they exist and this is a great way to have a legacy for the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
library and to people use it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So I was born about eight blocks from this building on the quantum East eighty third

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Street and Glenn McGrath. And I grew up my entire

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
adult life and Canarsie which is where that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is and I had. My grandparents came in one

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
thousand nineteen in this fight

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm telling you about and my grandfather had a farm that pretty much started about four or

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
five blocks from here ran along. And was

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
about two or three acres in that size at the time. And knows bass

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Canarsie was a very unique place if it had its built up area which was built in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you're only nineteen twenty's in the late teens early

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
twenty's and then they had what they called the back and the back was the area from back east

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
eighty eight st the routes have you from four storey M.-U. all the way

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
down to Pataky creek over here to all those areas south of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Flatland

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Sammy and I was called back because it really had almost no homes that a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
bunch of summer bungalows. And those bungalows remaining inhabited

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
by Sicilian Italians who came from Ridgewood

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Brooklyn and that was on the L. Y. Now many people see they hear about the El train today.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What most people don't know is the el train originating to actually

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
originally started in at the foot of.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Seaview pier. Which is down on the end of Rockaway Park when the Bell

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Parkway and this was a time when there was no Belt Parkway and that area was in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
fact an amusement

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
park from the late eighteenth hundreds into around the late one nine hundred twenty

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.000
S.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and it was called Golden City amusement park and the train

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
actually ran to where it is now Mark with Buckley now and then you switch to a trolley

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that roll all the way down Rockaway Parkway actually at the time the train

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
when in the middle of a whole bunch of empty land that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
was called

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the Long Island where recut that still there are many places and then

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was replaced by the trolley on Rockaway Parkway. So this is a pretty pretty much

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
rule where you're with had a lot of Tang an immigrant who's utilized

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it and it was there some a Holmes lived over in Ridgewood or

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Bushwick he lived in these four story frame walkups with no fans and no air conditioning

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and none of the amenities we have today and this was like their way of coming to the country and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it reminded them of the place that they originated

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
from so that became my home in the home of about forty seven of my

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
relatives my immediate relatives. So I can remember a time when

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I had. All of my aunts and uncles all of my first

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
cousins whole my friends live within that little. Six black area

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
from Fram's around C.N.N. New down

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to maybe eighty was now eighty H.P.D. stadia street

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
some square think so my connection with this library is pretty much goes back to when the day it

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
was built.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Prior to this library the built in the one nine hundred sixty S. by the way to a very I think was one thousand nine

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
hundred fifty S. that purpose whatever you know we had no I marries in this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
area the closest library was the Canarsie library which was located back then on

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Glenwood

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
road and east ninety fifth Street and it stared at the building this tall

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
there today and right next to it was the sixty one precinct police. Freezing which

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
also was at that that site until an early one nine hundred seventy S..

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So it's a real connection road as a real connection and I'm really saying I'm Islam because

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
back in those days.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We didn't have a glamour road it ended at a state third Street and there was no Farragut row

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because that ended at least eighty seven street. So we would walk to empty

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
fields and pets to come here that was building a coming of I call you walk here.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And that went on right pretty much so pretty

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
close to the end of the one nine hundred fifty S. before they actually built began

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
building what we call the new homes which all these brick attached homes are in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
these blocks

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
surrounding Patta get library when the library was built there was maybe

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
only it was a housing project where we now we call it there are other things where Glenwood

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
houses was here which is built in one nine hundred forty nine and almost nothing else.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I mean literally it was a housing development and then the library

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
in this hall and them

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
had crossed away from the library was an amusement park.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Miniature amusement park where they had kiddie rides and things like that and

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
where satisfied south to high school is now which is right across from the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
library on my family you know that was empty lots that was utilized for junk

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
yards

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and the Kona being what was kind of old fashioned they use called the rodeo Grill which is

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
great an old fashioned hamburger place. Out of there so it's a pretty unique place to live and

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
back that.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And that the only thing you knew for sure you were in this area was give us a pedicure treat

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
pumping station which is also visible from the library. OK would usually belch

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
out its fumes as the waters came through and all the sewers would come through into

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the creek.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So we had a pretty nice place where you can get you've got the sights the sounds and the smells

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
of all of our neighborhood sanding the front of the paddock in the library.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So now reason why the library is important to me. Well I think that's a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
mother question. So I

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
was going to be doing

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
fine in the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
past three

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
was I was very young when they had been in the E.U. I must've been about ten years old when they actually built

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
this library in the late fifty's. And and we were

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
all excited because it was finally a place that was close by that we could

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
utilize and you know back in the one nine hundred fifty S. and sixty's and

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I guess we can go right up into the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
ninety's there really wasn't many of the ways to have an ability

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to learn except through

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
books and the books that the library how was a true poet

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the treasure that all of us looked. Because we didn't have

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
any exceptions had what they called an

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
encyclopedia back then you a lucky if your family could afford us an encyclopedia

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and other than that you'd have to come to the library ferry resource that you needed to

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
school. And it was unique for me because I would go to. At

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the time I went to. Job Wilson High School which is located on

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
these two hundred street again in the middle of it totally and the area of

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
land was a school belt and we have the choice of either

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
going to the Canarsie library on our way home or if we were home. Over to

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
this library to be able to do our stunning.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Some Now why this place. Now I can tell you that the rest of the area was also as rule

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
as Iraq's plane to go with

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the RAF every new area that shopping centers that are here now weren't there. There was

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
a miniature golf course that was on there and the first substantial building that was

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
built is what's now D.P.C. Rich's building which was really begin

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Hodge's bowing out that was built.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But there was no Georgetown which is the neighborhood that.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
West. He stuck to our fare on the raft ever your side South Platte when there

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
was no Futurama which is the area that's out the flat lands on this side of

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Rafa ever you know meaning the west

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
side and flat lands which is this is the area that the library

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
is part of was really just beginning to be developed so we had

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the entire We had Glenwood

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
houses and a lot of empty lots and slowly was surely in the fifty's.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We saw this area develop of much homes we wanted to family homes being built.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So that what makes what houses so unique was when wood houses along

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
with Seaview Bayview houses and Brookline houses

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
were three housing developments that

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
were built here in this community and all three of them were built for

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
returning veterans who had served in World War

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
two and to try and help and assist in this really

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
really shortage of housing that was needed for all these millions of soldiers who came

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
home and now began starting their families and they were all built about the same time in the late

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
one nine hundred forty S.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and a very very a project was mine a mental look at it today because they

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
started building in one thousand forty six forty seven and they were completed by the one nine hundred forty nine.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
When do you see anything get done that fast. But they all

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
managed to take the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
veterans mostly better ones who are serving in more war two

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and becoming homes for their families. And going with us continue to be that kind

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
place. So. Now my connection with Grandma goes back a little bit more because

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
back in one thousand nine hundred sixty five.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
When I first graduated high school and I needed to get a job in January one thousand nine hundred

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
eleven from climate and I had this great opportunity a friend of mine was

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the manager of a

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
bank and he said to me he would offer me a job that paid

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
seventy five. That was a week.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
This in one thousand nine hundred eighty

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
five and I had to wear a suit and tie every day and pretty much have to

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
worry about where I was going to have

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
lunch and how to get it to the bank itself was a little bit out of the neighborhood.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And another friend had worked here as well we called a supervisor a

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
foreman in Glenwood houses in that and they had an opening for what they call

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the caretakers position.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And they can take it someone basically is a janitor who cleans the buildings as a project and they

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
had an opening they have a pay that paid eighty five dollars a week.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Plus overtime on the weekends and they get an extra twenty dollars a week twenty five

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
dollars a week and from working. Clubs. It was very low they gave you the forms and

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I could walk here every day from my

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
home. So what could be better than that and so there I was England Woodhouse's

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
working in one thousand January one thousand nine hundred sixty

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
five That began my career my real love affair with this

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
library help. I've had many many careers since that

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
day in one thousand nine hundred sixty five but the one that was propelled

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
me to some of the things I am to now was a result of my ability to use this

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
library had a good branch was an island of

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
sanity in their world of so much conflict and it will be a place I

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
would come to have every day at

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
lunchtime to take and study for the various simple service exams that were

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
given for the police the fire the sanitation many of the

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
other civil service jobs. That were out there that I would do that is I would take

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.000
the

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
books. From here from the library that they had then they would study books for these

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
tests and every day come and sit here and take the test with credit

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
to pretend to repeat

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
them and without exaggeration I did that pretty much about eight or nine months before the

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
test came on. And because of my efforts here and the help by the way of the

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
librarians and others who are very very. In those days and still are now very

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
very qualified people and I wound up

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
becoming my aunt and I took the test and I had if you understand

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
the civil service list the higher the number you are in the

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
list the better chance you have a B. of appointment.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So I was number twenty seven. Out of thousands on the New York City Police

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Department

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
as I was number nine on the housing back then there were different police departments.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I was number nine on the Housing Police West number seventeen on the transit

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
police list and number thirty on the fire department less.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So I did very very well and that's only because I was able to come here each

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
day and have the solitude of this environment to be able

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
to take those tests and study for and work

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
on time and time again until I was well prepared when the

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
time came that I had to take the actual exam.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I wound up getting called for the police department York City Police Department first

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and I took that position because it was the first one to be called

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and I don't know if the others would have called me I'm a great believer in faith

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
destiny and I think that was my destiny to be on that particular

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
police department and I was was a very successful career for me as a result.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So there I am right here in that I had to write all the age of twenty in nine months.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Being very excited about working for two years and when would have was and

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
then work studying here each

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
day and finding that the result of that was led to the beginning of

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
my career in public service.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Had a lot.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
When my friend I have many many friends in this community. So if

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
you as a matter of fact anybody who comes from this new huge comes to my house around

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Christmas

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
time. Because I put up a few Christmas light flatlands Avenue in these ninety

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
third Street where are you moved to for a while and we put up an

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
entire Christmas display that is the most renowned Christmas display in the

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
city and they are over three hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of Christmas

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
decorations and. All kind of animated dolls and all kinds

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of different. Window displays that are

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
a great great pleasure for the kids to look at and we just open those lights

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
on Wednesday on Sunday

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
night and I've done that for the twenty ninth year in a row that I've been doing

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
it and I haven't done private Minas much smaller scale.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So this is a from a neighborhood where I grew up in a neighborhood which have great regard

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
for and great deal of love and passion for a neighborhood that

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
has constantly been the

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
source of a current people. What's wonderful you know although this is what they

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
call the Patty good library really is the extension of the Canarsie

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
community and these communities and always been middle income communities and mostly

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
middle income immigrants people who've gone to that first opportunity to buy

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.000
their first

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
home. And that's what's so exciting about it many times is that we have people generation after

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
generation of immigrants from all over the world originally started with the Dutch we

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
can around and say you know the Canarsie in the is we here. And they were first here

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and they dealt with the

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Dutch back then selling them pieces of land that they didn't even own but they

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
took them anyway and had the original Dutch settlers set here and this

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.000
entire

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
community. This was farmland for many many many years and it's hard

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to perceive today because the different things that occurred in the end the allow men to have a

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
have a community generations are

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
such That's how it started and then it went and then it continued on

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to the English and then in this particular there was a very large

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
German and. German community the chain here and then finally in

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
the fifty's and thirty's and twenty's and thirty's

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
were

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Italians and then it developed into and then it became as

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
the

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
communities continued to grow and change or became the Jewish. A

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
large Jewish community that had moved south from Brownsville in East New

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
York and today it's

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
probably the most middle income Caribbean community in the city of New

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
York. We have I think forty seven different countries

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
represented a

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
currency from every island in the Caribbean.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Including that one that's way far over to the east Sicily.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Well

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
growing up it was a great adventure I went to public school one fourteen years which is on Remsen Avenue and when

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
we're broke. Now if you think of lumber OK Well marauders one of the last outposts in this part of

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
the world but it was one of the few streets that went down to the state Eritrea which is

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
where we live and it was a

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
paved lemon grove where I live was in pains until the mid fifty's

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
around fifty

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
seven fifty eight fifty eight I think it was before it actually was paved as

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
a paved street and had sidewalks. So you can imagine that we would use that it

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
was wonderful because I'm a road at the state search it was the end of the page to me.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So everything we used to have maybe a car

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
come down about one hour. As compared to when you see the traffic that's that I and

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that was basically our Paul

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
field and. We would spend many Some I can remember being ten

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
years old and finding an intersection of what's now east eighty fourth Street

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
of M. world a very large guy today. Under a rock had took it home

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
as my pet for a long period of time. That's the kind of community this

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
was and most of what happened was in the one nine hundred forty S. the late one nine hundred forty S..

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
The sewer system.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
There was no school system here until that tight and the sewer system was

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
developed and it was and it was six and it was already here.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And we had that's what raises what we call raised the street if you ever drive

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
to some of the side streets my road just noticed that when I came down you'll see that a lot of the homes that are built.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
They have these low tried ways they have answers to the back yard and that's

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
because that was the level of the street at the time.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So we didn't have the street was that

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
wall and they were and only for the stay put in the source

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
just now what that did was two things was it leveled off all the streets to the level that there

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
are today what we call street level and it took all that farmland that I told you

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
about and really made it

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
a like a rabid and

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
then open land and made these in Manc meant to cause all of this man to just

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
sit sit there and really not be utilized as much for the farmland. Because

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
what would happen when it rains it was the water goes down and it became very swampy.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So a good part of this area was swamp in those days because of that so. So a really

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
interesting place to grow up a site grown up in the country.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And our greatest thing will be I can remember being ten years old going over what is

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
now Pataky creek and trying a bunch of logs together and grabbing the snow along tree

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
limb and actually sailing out on the floating out on the

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
creek to about four or five dogs try to get of Iraq pretty much like Tom Sawyer

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
that on the Mississippi so we have and then this is our experience and

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
of course we never ever bought a scalding ball.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Now that's maybe an unheard of thing want to score mostly on the water Spalding dollars but it's

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
a rubber ball that you play handle weight or anything like that and the reason we didn't is because

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
all the sewers emptied into Pataky creek and Spring Creek back then.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So you would find a new every gets Spalding balls floating all over the.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Place and we will be taking them out washing them off and they became our play toys last

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
that and there are a lot of dumps here. Those days flatten and then you

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
wear where the school is now or or really

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
legitimate dumps dumping places for from debris and

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
things and I got my first bicycle

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
out of the pile in Flatland

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
venue

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
where we where is that memory got my first car out of their

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
junkyard flatlands area what's now probably the entrance to the south

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.000
to high

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
school I remember right now nine hundred sixty five my about I got a nine

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
hundred fifty six Ford Fairlane convertible for fifty dollars.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
That was the cost of the car the insurance was two hundred cost more than the car

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
itself and I would drive that car around it was not like being a thousand years only a

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
convertible and the neighborhood in those days and that was a great great pleasure. Said a lot of fun

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
with that.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Hi I was. We went to Tilden high school because there was no Canarsie high school was out

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
from high school and if you lived in this area or Brooklyn. Brockway park was like

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
a border like. If you lived East in Rockaway

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Parkway meaning going out towards towards East New York. You went to Thomas Jefferson High School.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
If you lived where asked Brockley park where you went to tell that high school. Those are the

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
only two high schools and we had what we call triple session back then of

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
course community had grown so

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
large that we would have three and four thousand students in school itself.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I think my graduating class was like eight hundred fifty or nine hundred students.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
At the time when I graduated high school. So you can imagine that today most schools aren't

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
that pick high schools but that was the way it was that.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And we all graduated everybody graduated at a low is King's Theatre was just reopened by the

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
way have always kings of flappers having I am all road hand it just.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
We opened that day as a theater venue but that was the place everyone went to

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
graduate us was the only building big enough to accommodate those large classes

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
of students and their parents. Has been a pretty nice experience crowd

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
there. What's that

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
all broken cars been around since the thirty's as a matter fact problem cause where I went to

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
school I went at night to Brooklyn

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
College and it took me fifteen years to graduate but I did it I

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
started when I was in my early twenty's and graduated when I was thirty five so thirty

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
years

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
ago I had a ripple we went at night. Back then if you had you work during the day it was one

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
of your school's and off night classes and we were all and thanks to a thing called open enrollment.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I was able to go back in your own seventies when I first thought I couldn't go to school when I first

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
graduated high school because counts because my family was very

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
poor and I needed to work in order to help assist my

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
mom and my other five brothers and sisters.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So my dad had been gone for quite a while by then.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And we my mom

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
re six kids by herself in that same well as still there.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
I remember I just passed it and I saw that someone helping the stupid in the

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
front who talked about building that's two for about fifty years and somebody actually just below

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
on my way here Sal and trusting

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
that. Every once in a while I stop by here just talking past and see what it looks like.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And I have my entire family living in like a three block area. My uncles and aunts and I

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
are everybody and everybody knew everybody.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
It was not like you could do anything in this neighborhood wrong was that we wanted to tell your grandmother your mother

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
or your rant or something. You know

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and we had no buses in the ninth in the nineteen fifties.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
The only buses we had here are ten

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
R.C. was the beast that was the sixty Wilson which came down

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Rockaway Park white.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Had traveled. And to merge with the Bushwick. And we

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
had. Seventeen Remsen which

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
left from Utica revenue in Eastern Parkway and came down again ended at

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
the rock right proper train station which And now finds an M U two routes one that went up

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
to when the road and then up to her right train station and the other went that the Seaview

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Avenue down to maybe you have this.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And that was it. There was no other buses and tell the white ones the mid sixty's that thing when we got to

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000
be six we were all excited we had an actual bus to go to another part of Brooklyn.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And today we have about nine bus lines and it's very

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
interesting to say and this is a community I truly

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
grew had a New York of as New York City grew so did you know I stand there and

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
the empath flatlands in the Patton area. It's

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
absolutely. Great place to grow up. It was it was

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
like being in your own country home. Awesome a lot.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
The three of us to one is in Florida and to live in I call

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
it cupcake like one Kancha like one can come out of the

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
ark have two brothers who were there but every was everyone was here and probably

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.000
were

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
adults so and we have four generations of kids and.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
P.S. one fourteen my

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
parents and my aunts and uncles all went to P.S. one fourteen and I and

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
my brothers and sisters and all my first cousins and then my children and a lot of my nieces

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
and nephews and even a fourth generation my great niece and nephew who worked on

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
fourteen graduated and that's how we have a long history with that

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
school and then.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I think if I had to speak about the greatest memories I

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
have of this community in about the library itself is how much how

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
much I didn't

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
realize how good it. As for me

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I don't like it reflected back to

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
life. And then

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
sort of realized that what I did

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
here to stay out of a whim out of a thought of saying this in that space and quite there let me

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.000
go over

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
there and how much that made a difference in the

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
entire circumstance of my life like it was a foundation

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
from this building.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I received a foundation that allowed me to build up my mind the mansion of the pivot.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
So I was always very very appreciative of

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
that and very supportive of the libraries boss. I don't think the young people

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
really appreciate what's

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
here. Well give enough time to

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
it and you know in my day my mom had a six kids so I

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
pretty much had to do things

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
myself at some point to go so many children

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
today don't have the library.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
They have parents are too busy to get them here and we have all these other distractions which

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
do nothing for you

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
educationally and sometimes I wonder if they even do anything for us at the payment

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
wise but that they have they're losing that great

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
opportunity to learn from the best place in the whole of

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
the fountain of education. It's not the schools. It's to

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
libraries and what we do after we finish with school.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Me.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And when I have to give anything I want to encourage our young people today.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And today I can say I have a lot of authority since I'm old. If I'm going to be

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
seventy years old next

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
year and that live a long life here spent almost all seventy of

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
X. and the entire seventy years of my life in Temple life within ten blocks of this building.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
That I think if I have you any encouragement to

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
anyone it is take

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
time to really take time to learn.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
I when I was very young I never considered myself a great reader but I would come

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
here every comic books. There was a book or classics are straight.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Now why did I do that was when I had a study to get back my time you had to take an exam you had to

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
do something and so on as classes as classic sources like the shortcut so if you

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
read the comic book version of Tom Sawyer like all the bad facts it was enough to get me

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
through a little I know to all of that reading I was only never

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
really got me to the point to have an excellent ability to

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
read. And I think that's the most

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
important thing that people can detect being able to read and being able

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
to write well is one of the most ingredients to

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
success. You can only talk so much they have to be able to do.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And your ability to communicate in writing.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And your ability to read in a stead.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
What's before you makes the difference in how successful you are in your

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
life. Thank

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
you and. You're

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
welcome.
