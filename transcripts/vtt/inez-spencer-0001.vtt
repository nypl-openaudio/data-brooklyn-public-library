00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well my name is pain. And I'm here when I Miss

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Benson and today if January twenty eighth two thousand and sixteen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We advocate a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
library for the after our stories project at Brooklyn public library films I never

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
before the my way from.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes I transferred to dos to in housing in the year two

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
thousand from Coney Island Houses. I found the neighborhood to be

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
all seemed quiet friendly but

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that was fixing years ago. Things are different now.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Should I continue where you have more questions. Oh

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
well the element is on the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
negative and it wasn't been.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well when we first arrived what did

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it was well as

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I said it was very clean the area was quiet and the people

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of extremely friendly. Now you know it's difficult to get a good morning

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
from your neighbors and that type of thing you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
know part

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of that because you know I joined I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
retired so I've joined a couple

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
of. Programs that they have here in

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
a neighborhood. You know one is the. Base Senior Center which

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is very nice you know you meet a lot of people and everything. So you know the lunches are

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
delicious for one

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
dollar or so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the the kings of a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Y. which is on

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Avenue B.'s the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
notion and it's it's very good as a beautiful pool

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
an exercise room.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I have exercise classes are all the classes and that type of thing people

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
are very nice there as well you know but the main thing that I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
was really excited about is the Tenet

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
association with the father of McFadden He is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
president and I learned about them through pulses

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
the memorandums and stuff that were placed in the buildings and stuff

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and if you know she's she's really trying to bring

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the neighborhood back to as when I first moved here. You know she's gotten

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
all sorts

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of programs.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The recycling program which is good clean cleaning up the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
neighborhood and I got a lot of alums.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
all you know than me one of the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
nicest things that she have to win is a GED program which is partnered with

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the Brooklyn College. So that's that's very nice.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
She she had a youth

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
summit to Albany was she took a lot of the you see you know

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and you know teaching them how life is and how to pay them for life

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and you know a lot of different things you know her her motto

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is you know taking back the community. You

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
know it was she she was really working hard you know she's the a breath of

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
hope here no light at the end of the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
tunnel. You know type of person though you know with her. I think

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm going to be the year two

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
thousand in August and once

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
again with a lot of children when you first arrive.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Yeah the way.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Well you know I think the change came about

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because a lot of the seniors. You know these are the people that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
were living here. For years and years and years when I moved

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
in there with a like a few of my

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
neighbors that way here like twenty years in

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and. Longer than that thirty years and forty years of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
them and a lot of them are dying out. You know. So as they die out

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and stuff and then the apartments are being taken over by people that aren't

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
as caring. Still that's what a

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
change is coming about you know you just don't seem to you see

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
children just going to see children as young mothers I'm moving in. Now and that type of thing.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
yes in my building we don't have very many young children but we

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
have a few.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Maybe about six families or something like that.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Here

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
who will live life in the community are the coming

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and oh well Coney Island was fantastic.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I've moved into a new building that had just gone up.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This was in the seventy's and I moved in with

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
my young daughter at the time and then I had another daughter while I was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the but it was gorgeous. I

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
mean it was like the best place for me to raise my kids you

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
know I would work and their backyard was the beach and

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the amusement park and the aquarium. You know and the parks were fabulous

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
then you know very nice soul. You know my family for

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
LARP and moved out as the so I didn't need a big apartment anymore it was

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a duplex on top of that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So it was very nice very

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
nice and if so I moved to Florida death but

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
maybe transfer over to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
notion less rooms I didn't need as many in

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the here. We

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:04.000
always born and raised I was born in Harlem Hospital. Yeah. So.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I don't remember very much about Harlem because we moved into

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Brooklyn what green area was where I was raised.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And we moved

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
here when I was hanging when I was very young I don't even know

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the age. But I was a school there and all of

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that and. I'm losing my train of thought that

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that's what you call a senior

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
moment. Anyway.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
for Greenlee What do you remember about that era

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
disposed of for green it was great friends were

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
different back then you know I was born in. Fifty one

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
still times were different

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
then you know your friends in with sibilance you know and you ran

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
the streets with each other and we played games we actually played games as kids punchbowl

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
a ring a levy all and all of that or you went to your girlfriend's health

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and ate and your mom fed them and there was it was great it was it was a

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
beautiful community.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I'm still in touch with some of those people now you know because that's how I was

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
friends were friends you know and we know each other's children and all of

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that so many years

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
later but I you know what King was very very nice when I've been

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to public school and did you know high school there.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Has a lot of us stayed with me was.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
P.S. sixty seven was the public

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
school and sand junior high school.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Yeah. I I went to say

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
a jail.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
You know

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that third or third Avenue no. Sin Brooklyn.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Vocational program. Yes yes yes yes yes I took the nursing. Program. Yeah

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
yeah so it was good

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to win into the co-op program is that they had things like

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that they had so many things back then to encourage young people

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
to go to school like there is a tomorrow is own like the.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Like the co-op program where you work a week or two to try to get was then and you go to

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
school for two weeks you have to be a good student for that of course to be able to keep up your

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
classes and then at the end you able to work with this from whatever

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
company to put you in what was is a

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
great incentive. Yes yes yes this yes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They had so much and also the young children. Unlike unlike

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
now you know they they're not thinking about the youth.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
They don't have very much

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to occupied and my brothers went to the boys and girls high school

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
playing basketball and all these different things so they you know

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
all those programs have been cut out. Unfortunately I remember

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
him for green there was a.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
A

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
A Catholic Church was in the name of the church all I

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
can remember the church right now because I'm under

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
pressure. As say Michael St

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Edward's and

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
this priest used to have all sorts of programs to get us off the street you

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
know he would have nice movie nights you know what we would go we'd watch movies

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and he would have basketball tournaments and all sorts of things you

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.000
know

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
just everyone seemed to just open your doors to the young people you know.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And unfortunately you know that's what they need when they finish with school they need another place to go.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I believe now. You know because the you know the

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.000
parents and

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and I my my both my parents worked here and also. We will latch

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
key kids you know but these are but when you. You

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
know that it was took the neighborhood to raise one child you know when you

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
weren't really alone you know if you had anything you're going to explore to miss this value Mr

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Weber whatever you know

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
so people have to now start

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
reaching out again

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and sewing something I don't know what the change is

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.000
none of

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the great about the change of the status

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
of the YES YES YES YES YES I'm loving it

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
because I'm able to to get into the different committees

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that Barbara sets up. You know.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So it makes me feel good to know I'm doing some things you know.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What the for what they

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
do was lose it's a lesson in this area.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Even

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
a father

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
here sixty

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
well I really you know I could tell the I couldn't

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
really tell you much about the neighborhood because I worked. You know so I

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
basically went to work and I had my children. Well I don't have my child when

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I moved here but I worked

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
in I worked twice town at Long Island College Hospital.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So by the time I got home I was just in my house and ready for the next day

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
type of thing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But since since I've retired is true to Plaza they put up

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the signs and stuff and they've beautified it a little you know but

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I really don't know much about the neighborhood I'm more or less learning about it

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
now since I have the time to walk around and see what's available and what it's

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in and that type that the so we speak with

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the library.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Oh yes I come to. The library. I don't wanna speak negative of it

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but that told me where you could speak of this library

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
because they they're very noisy you can't concentrate

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
on whatever it is you know when and in not only to the kids to comment

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the staff as well the yelling

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
across a family Did you follow whatever you

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
know or

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
or you know they need to clean up the

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
the the restrooms a little better. You know it's it's really

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
bad so maybe they

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
need to hire a housekeeping person or whatever you

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.000
know

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
but the programs that they have point

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
really much for the kids you know it's like some board games that this is for little kids and

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that type of thing but you know get something for the teenagers you know that they

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
can get more involved

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
with that's why you know they come here I

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
guess out of the cold and all

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
of that and you know they sit in a me play games or something that they

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
may bring in themselves to share or something like that you know so of course you know they're going to

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
be talking and what have you as I guess that's clear that noise comes in you got a cut on this

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.000
thing and

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but you know when I come I like to be quiet sit and read my book and get into

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
the characters and all of

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that you know

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
but it could be a bed a library if they if they

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
whoever runs it that

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I care about it a little more about the neighborhood in one

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that but it's the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the the shelves of plenty of books and you know it's

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
it's fairly clean it's just a rest rooms that

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
aren't and.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
That's all the negative I have

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
this. Ball

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to poor library.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And the libraries like it was a big thing in raising my kids we they

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
had to live used to have a lot of programs reading programs and all sorts of things because I

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
have my daughter is involved in all of that they don't have that here you know.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You know you read so many books and you get a free book in there was one of the program I did

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
so long

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
local one time memories coming back home.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
life was different back then people cared about people and they were cared about kids

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in you know nowadays you see a teenager come to the door ready you. You know want

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to defense. You know and it should not be you know it doesn't matter what race

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the child is

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
it's still the same reaction. You know and that a helping you

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
know the young. What do they know they don't know about how to approach or how to not

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to approach to teach them so OK but when you come in and say such and such

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
will you remove your head only you know what I have to learn.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
You know five and they you know you want to talk and.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
When leaving.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I think something will give me a little it's

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
up.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So you said you're going to learn about me and he frequently. Why are you

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
hearing him. There is how

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
you know in your community that.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Before.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
All those are the three centers that I do call to I

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
go down the block and I get fine nails and feet done and the people know me P.S.O. You

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
know I've you know we talk. It's

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
no Chetry in and why.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Yes and I go there I get buy nails and then sit and talk

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
with the ladies of

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
the. And then there's a deli.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Dyna right on the corner

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
of the and no Strand.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Every now and then I'll go in and the guys know media you know

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
when and it's nice to go there because they just all high and they bring me my stuff

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
sold you know I feel like a queen you know. So when I have visitors I bring them here.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So it's very very very clean very nice the food is good and

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
not expensive. You know over the expensive

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
pedal. Where else do I thought oh I like all to

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Kings Plaza or of course and you know down the flat boyish

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and I just wonder

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
why it's so good after working so many years to

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
just wake up and say What am I going to do

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
today where which direction am I going to

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
go. Yeah

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
but that's the tenant though she

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
says it's great because I have learned a lot of my neighbors.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
You know and it's good that meetings

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
are very informative.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
know

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I don't know from the other things to say.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Something

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
that. Well basically I

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
just have a list of the programs that was started

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
by

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000
association. One that you're particularly proud of that you work for.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
One mission one.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Well you know during Christmas time. This big

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
fan and I stay at the

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
they got together a trip to a Christian Cultural

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Center feces. Everyone knows that church mostly and it was green

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
it was a they had a Christmas show and at the end of the show the kids got

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
a

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
toy and a book you know and they you loved it it was great

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
you know so I was one of the chaperones on the bus.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You know but it

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
was it was very nice very nice I thought there was very sweet.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
People were on the bus.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Well whatever the bus holes because it was full and everyone was

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
seated. But I don't know how many see that in

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
the Bible. It was very nice and the kids were

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
so well behaved as they are you

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
dolt as they always are

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
so that was nice and they all

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000
live. In the area here in the area.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I know in the beginning when I first started coming to the.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Meetings they they had a nutrition

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
program and that was nice I learned a lot from that and

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I think it was like one day added a week for like six weeks or something

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
like that and you learned a lot

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
about counting calories and reading

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
labels and things of that.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
But I really got a lot out of that because I used to take the.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
P.S.L. oil pills I forget black seed pills or something like

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
that and in the class. You know you'd learn that those polls tablets

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
they put like the worst oils you had oh it's not it's not quality.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
So I said Oh what am I doing so I stopped taking that you know when you have to be careful

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
you know then I guess that's why they tell you to when you're taking these open account of

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
supplements you should you know speak to your physician because they can tell you.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
More or less that this. What's good or what isn't good

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
or you know that type of

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
thing but. It was fun

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
it was very very informative.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
That's what I like about our partnership make sure that you.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
You know you're learning and you know she's she's a person that believes

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
in sharpening the mind you

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
know you know will

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
help her meetings and I

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
just you know they're all informative somehow you've been formed

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
about something you

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
know and she feeds you. Oh my

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
goodness she's all thoughtful because people are coming from work or whatever you know

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
and she always says of me only a four year you know sometimes.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Actually I don't know who the cooks but the food the usually very good chicken

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
and mac and cheese or not you know always a dessert.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And believable that lady is and she's coming from work or self.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
You know so she makes plans all of

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
this. So I look forward to

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
our meetings.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
With Suze very little.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
But.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Well is there anything that you like to two generations to know

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
about King same even and

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
in

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
one's own area.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
What to expect. Well.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I'm not a fortune teller so I don't know

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
but

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
but F. thinking so starting to progress as it

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
is maybe you

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
know things be better because I see the kids outside

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
now claims basketball and stuff like that which I didn't see

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
before you know so I guess maybe some young man decided to get some

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
kids together and get. Team together whatever it

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
is but I don't know I don't even

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
know how to answer that

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
one maybe one

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
moment Les's you may have learned.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Let me hear oh

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
yeah

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
well at sixty five this folly any less

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
incentive you're going to learn from a neighborhood that you haven't learned from any other you know you just

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
learn how

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
to you know we all live here together. You know. And no one

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
is better than the

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
other and we should just reach out our hands and I help one another the best we

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
can

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
and basically that's it you know you see some

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
huge remember you're growing up. You know the elders you

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
just reach out for the elders see if they need help here Knowledge children the

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
children understand that you know you were child once in and I get so upset

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
but little noise the whatever it is you

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
know or the

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Basically that's it you know we're all here together.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
You know you you may have a better job or you may not have a job but we're all in the same boat.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So you'd know better then than the next

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
person and that's a lesson for everyone to

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
know here.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Well thinking this isn't a high this is and sharing your memory.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
This is one. OK. Thank you.
