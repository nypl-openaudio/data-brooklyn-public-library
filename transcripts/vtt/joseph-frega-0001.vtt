Drew Peterson and as we've gotten older and talk about those times the plays become

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
more dramatic The catch is more exciting.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It becomes a little fabricated but those are very nice memories

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as well as the Regina you'd sent the original part just as my parish

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000

Pacifica a lot of other

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
nice memories and they put just the sense of community. Everybody had each other's back

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and you know it's funny now because now. Now I am fifty two and there are some neighbors that are left on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.000
my

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
block. You know a lot of people have moved but those that are still on

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that block you still have that sense of community and watching each other's.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Back and you know those that use the yell at my brother and I for playing baseball in the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
school yard we never really broke maybe want to Windows but you know we were known as the.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But Cassidy and the Sundance kids at the time you know for playing ball which

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
nowadays pales in comparison to what you do find on Fortunately on

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
corners and in school yards of what's going on we were kids playing ball or riding up bikes.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You know

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
all good natured stuff nobody mean but you know. Now you

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
know when you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
when you talk about it with those that are there now respectable guys

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
we're always we're good guys you know and that whole nature that you always have some bodies.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You always had somebody back. Maybe you didn't totally see eye to eye with a neighbor but God

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
forbid if any body bothered anybody on that block or something like that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
everybody would pitch in in fact my friends and I one night it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
was in one thousand nine hundred ninety nine and he was in one thousand nine hundred

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
one some young girl

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
got her a pocketbook

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Rob and. One of the side entrance of the church my friends and I were like about twelve or

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
thirteen guys and we helped so we knew every little and we caught the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
guy you know we caught him he tried to blend in was really we don't know you and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the cops were there be took away all bad guys we all came out with. You know we were

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
kids you know we're in our twenty's whatever you know that

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
but you invaded our block that that wasn't tolerated. If a neighbor.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
When we were growing up my friends and I were leaning on somebody's scarf the music was too loud. Somebody

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
said Guys can you low guys or just clean the car. Yes OK was sorry and that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that sometimes in today's society and of course the Internet

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
whatever that sense of courtesy and respect but neighbors has gone out the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
window but. Those are my words also my really my warmest memories

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
of Dica hypes been able to go up the fight goes which thank God is still there

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
on eleventh they haven't you and you know you got when they're on a Saturday you got your

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
sandwiches and.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Oh what was even like in

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the demographic.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Demographics basically a little more Italian oriented at the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
time and it is still around but it was at that time it was more

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
primarily a tongue in oriented oriented

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
community but that far as the demographics as far as I mean certain Some

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
businesses have have left the neighborhood of how to close over the years but I think

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that would be the biggest the biggest thing the demographic was it was more now it's mix which

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is no problem with that on don't take me the wrong way but it was more

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
primarily an

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Italian

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
based community. Lika

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
heights. At that particular junction Well when I was growing up.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I was born in this area. Yes I was.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
When I was. Like I said fifty

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
two my first three years I lived on sixty second between

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
eleven and twelve and then we moved to sixty six between twelfth and thirteenth and that's

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
where my mom has been living now that's going on fifty years this

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
year you know so I'm in a neighborhood for a long time. But overall it's good

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I mean you know there's Thankfully there's no real

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
major problems in the area but areas change

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
as society changes but you

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
know overall the height of still a very nice place to.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
To live in and raise a family.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And you

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
know over the years well the celebrations that happened over the years.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Regina poshest back in the day when I was a kid I mean I had to be in

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and we're between eight to thirteen years old used to have a street there

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
from sixty fifth and all and thirteen down to seventy fifth and

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
thirteen as a whole because of all that I remember from my window or from my porch use be

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
able to see the ferris wheel in the car they'll talk a lot Kabul used to be on sixty

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
fifth on the corner of sixty fifth and thirteen and that's another nice memory going

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
baseball home that my brother and I had almost every team of not every team.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I remember as a kid going up to the Fort Wayne movie theater on sixty seventh and

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.000
for

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
they you know and these are all very very nice nice

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
memories as far as what the celebrations. When I used to play baseball for

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Regina PA just they used to have like are a sub a Tory mass to begin the baseball season

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and I

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
know a little. Parade around the neighborhood all the stress in our baseball uniforms

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
all of us future all thought is unthinkable

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
ballplayers walking around like we're big shots but that's that

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
was it and now they still have some street there's I mean the eighteenth their new Fiesta

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
still intact

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that tradition for decades I mean that goals that stretches from

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
sixty fifth and eighteenth of the seventy fifth anything that's been

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
around for a long long time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And he visited the library

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and I'm always here. I've got to go I'm always stopping in over

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
here to look up stuff for the print out

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
front that's just like I come to this library often. Remembering.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Memories is when you have to use that have to do book

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
reports when you have your projects. Back then going the are circa one nine

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
hundred seventy S. when I was in grammar school or even in high school in the early

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
eighty's. You'd have Google then have the Internet where at a touch of a bunch used to

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
have to go to a library and look up encyclopedias.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You know I know that it looks like something the Antique Roadshow now but you stuff to look up in

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and encyclopedias and used to have to research your work

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
so that's why that's where the

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.000
library

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
became very useful. For

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
us and my friends and I you know when we had big reports and stuff like that

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
or things to do per school. You came to the library and that's when you did your

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
research work if you had to go back in and research things off

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
of

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
encyclopedias know not Google not Twitter. The Facebook. No.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.000
None of

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that you know you just have to go to a library and read through

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
your stuff and make copies or write down your

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
notes. Oh oh.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
As you live in this is the library.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Is one of the banking system

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and you know it was it was a central player because if you did have

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
a lot of studying to do for a fine old or any type

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
of examinations you know sometimes the four walls of your house gets a little close then

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
you know you will take a little

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
walk get a little fresh air clear your head come to the library was quiet and do

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
you studying and do you know what do some

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
homework as far as that goes what he needed and you want to take out a book

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that you were looking to they wanted to read especially

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
when you're when you're young and older before the Barnes and Noble's and everything.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Became a major player. This is this was the source that you came to you came to your local library.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the friends or

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
family. Know none of us all legends in our

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
own mind. Like I say school

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
your school your memories that become for blog now when you when you

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
talk with your friends we've had some reunions and you know of course the stories come up when we play football

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and you know who did this catch was and you know everything is fabricated is it's all a lot

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
of a lot of good fun. You know to reminisce.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Because like I said you had a lot of good a lot of good memories and all of us.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Thankfully we had very good. You know good families and stuff

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
unfortunately some of us including ourselves myself have lost family members like fathers

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and uncles over the years and when you do

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
go through things like that as you get older and

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
you do look back on on things those memories become even more in the

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
airing and you realize really how lucky. Excuse me I'm blessed that you

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
were and that you are.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
You know lucky hang out locations for me as a. Kid growing up.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It was up on the corner like I said buddy apartment building listen in the mechanisms down

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
on sixty six then eleven.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
As far as going out when I was you know

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
when you hit that age where you're able to go out to the blogs and stuff it would be Third Avenue. But there are

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
avenues more pay Ridge. Harriet's not really to dot the Heights area. So as

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
far as hanging out and like a height. It would be the schoolyards

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
playing. Playing automatics in this we are sixty ninth and.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And twelfth fifth was an automatic homerun if not the fourth was a homer of course

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
it was an out things like that playing football and they're playing what a matic

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
softball

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
fastball in the in the attic which is the school yard that's located on the corner off the corner of

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
sixty four and and twelve the avenue or as a

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
kid growing up you know before you were really old enough

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to branch out and leave your block read questions Fritzi in a pub just who you are. Were football that was our

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Shea Stadium Yankee Stadium. I was but Haralson who

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
was Larry ball you know and you want to talk about graffiti OK was graffiti but we used

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to write on the school yard fence. So we used

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the box scores of of our games and

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and stuff playing basketball off of

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the. The garbage pails that they put in the point of these large containers so

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.000
we had

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
to

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
roll the regular like garbage pails and we

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
used to shoot hoops and stuff like that playing the skulls in the street and

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
my neighbor I was a bottle caps and used to melt the. The crayon to get the

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
cap a better

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Smoove right when you hit when you were hitting it again playing slap

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
ball playing hockey in the schoolyard reaching apologise across the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
street from a used to ice the puck. You used to get the rolls of the black electric tape

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
to keep him in the freezer that's where his ace lives better. On the contrary. And

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
unfortunately you don't see that anymore. And that's a

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
little bit of a problem and

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
that's why these kids aren't as active as they should be and that's why obesity I think with

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
with children is up and I come to a library like I do

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
today and the kids are wrong the things and all the doing is playing computer games.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's a beautiful day it's a Friday afternoon you don't have any school.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It's a long weekend get out there play some football play some basketball be more active

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
but like I said those those things that at that was my childhood I wanted whatever the season

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
was we had something going on bowling basketball or

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
football we there was the the light on the corner if there was enough light got the ball

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
smacked around whatever that's that's what we

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
did and no those were my hang out and. In Dhaka heights I mean

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000

know I think any of this no one and no.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
No that basically it and then the other thing that let me add to is my block we're

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
fortunate we had block parties and I was ten years old and we had our first one in one

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
thousand nine hundred seventy three and not a day

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
either but we had block parties it was a big thrill you were able to ride your bike in

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
the street and you know and then we had one of seventy four that it stopped and we

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
got a new bunch of young. Neighbors that moved in and then we had one in eighty six

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and eighty

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
seven and by that time now in my twenty's and so my friends of course were at all

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
block this is all block that was the over that was the block playing you

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
know. Having a block party. Having your friends over

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
or you know enjoying like your mom's cooking and they would bring over

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
food we would be playing in the street different that different games.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
We played. Would we play. Oh musical

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
chairs where the guys would sit on a chair and a woman would walk around my

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
friend Dino for me at it again if they like the second or third times I was flirting with his wife

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
you know a good natured flirting of course but I'm just saying he's like I said as you get

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
older in

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
life and you get to look back you realize how looking at bless your work is not a

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
lot of people have those type of really nice memories of their

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
childhood or their or the neighborhood and I'm very

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
blessed that I

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
do I really am I mean my aunts the four blocks away to

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
my sixty second allotment and you know my aunt to my uncle's unfortunate my uncles are passed by

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
my aunts God bless them eighty five and eighty eight are still

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
there and I you know that that that place that at that a second home. That's where

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I grew up playing ball again because I had growing up I had guys we were all

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the same age and we all became friends and stuff

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
like I said I have very very very blessed that I have very very good memories of

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.000
my

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
childhood my neighborhood that I grew up with and

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
my

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
family and not a lot of people have

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
that unfortunately.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Value play the lottery that says

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
oh yeah golf I never got into golf and tennis. I wasn't didn't have a good hand eye

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
coordination my younger brother was a very good tennis player. I never had that hand eye

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
coordination for for tennis

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
and golf one of the guys really we were football basketball

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
hockey baseball mainly baseball and football and I enjoyed

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
the bowling Rejean apologist when the Regina youths out there was very

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
active downstairs they had lanes. They had bowling lanes.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And when I was in Regina poshest grammar school they had leaks. For the kids

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
different ages and I belong there fact my mom volunteered she was a score keeper when I was

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
younger and then as I got older my cousin and

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
a couple of his

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
friends we were a forman they had the form in leagues and

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
my father got us to so many times over he belonged to the league to the mentally. So

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I guess it was a very very active neighborhood especially what

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
was going on that.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Regina with the church and the school junior partner school

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
went there. You

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
know graduated there in seventy seven. So like I said this was a

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
very it was a very active nice nice

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
time you need really nice pubs and I

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
know everything was in walking distance just the only time that we my friends and I would take public

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
transportation was out when we travelled into the Bay Ridge but that wasn't until we were

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
older and tell you to and it seems everything that we basically did was

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
really within a mile the two mile area walking distance

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
of where we were born and raised.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Oh well let me begin life. My.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Family is the center of everything you have a good thing Amalie kids today I've got a

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
nice That is for God bless and nephew that is seven

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
and you want to enrich them with family. They know that their

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
love they enjoy their own tools they enjoy their families your

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
families really the center of everything and the other thing that I learned to is

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
that good friendships I mean really good true

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
friendships something that you know it sounds cliche but it. They are

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
priceless

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
and the other thing that you learn too as you get older in life is that not everybody

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
has what you may have been lost.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And embrace it. Enjoy it. Appreciate

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
it because it's not it's it's not always and

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
hasn't always been there for people you learn just as you get older and you know

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
you go out to high school and college and you get to know more people and you hear about their backgrounds and

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
their families what their fault is

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
especially their you don't always have what

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.000
you

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
had and how sometimes you know it's

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
the it's easier said than done but sometimes when you're in the middle of it you don't realize

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
that sometimes you do you can't take for granted thing is that everybody's got this. But

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
again I can't repeat it enough as you get older and you stop branching out into life.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
You realize that not everybody did and that's when you take

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
a step back and say you know what Dan

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
it really lucky I've been really blessed and I can I know I've been saying that a

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
lot but it's the truth and that's really what the Heights has

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
been all about. I may have been very blessed to grow up in this area

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
with the friends that I've had over the years childhood friends even if we don't stay in contact with each other

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
anymore people and life's and moved on

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
but there's always be that sense of neighborhood. Whenever you run into those

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
guys or those people. They want to talk about.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I think we covered

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
about about everything. Like I said I

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
mean it was it was a great time growing up

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
in and like a high. I mean you know. Guys the guys

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
and kids are kids and listen you got picked on you got

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
bullied. A little bit

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
but you know what if you got bullied and you got picked on. You always had a family to fall back on and that's what

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I honestly came on the stand with with today when these kids are and I understand that that high school is

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
rough and I. Then the S.P.L. pressure. It's always been around. It's always

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
been around. Well back when your

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
family half if things are getting getting too hard.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
As far as that goes.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And that's one thing that I didn't learn because I did I got back up bullied a little bit in high school I

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
got picked on because I had the glasses when I went to high and went with the car high school and when

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I went

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
to to grammar school when you got called names. I hate to say

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
but that's a normal course of growing up and unfortunately

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
think in today's society. Everything just gets too overanalyzed and you know

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
what it all comes down

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
to what goes on within the four walls of

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
home of home at dinner table not a

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
nice memory. Don't touch upon dinner table my father was always home for

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
dinner and it was always important that we talk.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
How did they go. How school.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
What's going on in your life.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
OK I

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
think I have and I know society has changed a lot

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and with the economics of it all of that but take.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Take the

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
time take the time to sit and talk with the kids talk with your

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
wife talk with your husband communicate. OK

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
what's on T.V. or stay on T.V. You can D.V.R. whatever you can do now. OK.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
The main thing is communicating and I love to get this one of my math

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
teachers in Bishop for because I was whole trouble with math of never my my best subject in high

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
school and I went for tutoring and they went up for an open

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
house and he complimented my parents pushed me taking an active role in your

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
kids and your children's life and that's the key there for get

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
my for my legacy my father unfortunately is passed it's going to be twenty four years this February twentieth.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
They passed away on his fifty four.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
But. Anyway.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
My mother always played the heavy. I mean we knew what we could do what we couldn't do with my dad only. He was no pushover.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
But my mother told us after repair to go who always thought that I was playing what having that your father was a little

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
more passive a little more laid back. She was let me tell

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
you once you used his car and you pulled away and you away for about fifteen twenty minutes

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
or your friend pick you up and you guys were going off and I thought he would wait about twenty minutes or

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
so he would go through the draws he think if he found a

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Playboy magazine in mind if he found an X. rated tape you know if we were killed. We were

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
guys you're going to try to hide that from your parents although they knew you were doing it anyway

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
but that's again that's a normal thing a ritual of growing up and the main thing is you want to

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
make sure he wasn't finding

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
drugs and if he did he would have addressed.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Nowadays we live in society where that could be a voice.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
It's called parenting. It's called staying in touch and and unfortunately

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
today we have to have commercials that are trying to teach people to do

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
that where they. You know that's what they did at

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
that house that was what was done and you know my brother my younger brother is forty nine

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
and he's got two kids like I said my niece that is four and my nephew that seven every night

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
they have dinner at the table. They

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
talk nice and mine and my nephew we provide them with

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
a lot of love you know we spoil them a little bit within reason you know with the purpose being an uncle I get

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
to give them back but that's the whole key sense of family and that's really I think the

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
biggest thing that I learned as a good

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
family. It's like working out your body you need that solid core and then

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
all the other muscle groups and everything fall into place and you have a very good core family.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Everything else in life really just falls into place.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Right well.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Thank you for your time.
