00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I bought a big hit it very day and I got to the library to go arrest all

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
so we took it and

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
then another sad story when I was a lot of good deeds and I

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
didn't when I first was one time a Holmes guy.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I was trying to help out all the time and one time I had I got extra money actually I

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
said Bob He was a veteran here and he said to dispute his wife new to strictly street.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
She wonders why Bob let me treat workers today. So I vomited I know I go you eat.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
He said at one table I said it was. Lazy. I

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
created but then he walked out and then only Comeau Can you see Joe was

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
a nice Dean you did but don't do it again I said way he should be my question was could use most

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So sometimes you try to do good and another time. That was in my

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000

trying to put on the underwear

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
again and I said Do you know God will help and in a black eye pondering

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
about it how long have I been praying on always.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
A meal I was just an attorney and I was assistant one machine

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
it as a kind of guy but.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Oh sure I do I do hope the underdog and.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Judge me address guys who do you write letters to my wife has

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
a job. And how to get what I was tested

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I did some and and when I was a job something happens

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
you have to

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
me Your give us sixty seventy dozen dollars and what I have left

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
To say my debt to my boys see my dads in a better

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
place with is no more pain does no more Salo does no Marge good.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
He's happy. So he don't want to be said he enjoyed

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
my wiped away no black usually laugh about my dad she meant my dad

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
always kids yet it is number one rule is what your mother made needle for Measure

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
did he always say. What you want but remember

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
you will eat every day you take some time I could use a vision.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
That was a fish supper five my mother's where I could read it all. And I was a

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
lazy ation so he knew he didn't need reading carriages retainers and my mother

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
going home which always finished and then after it was tried to from oh my mother's mother

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
stopped pushing you know but I never let my kids lose

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
and I said and what I when I die you know me I'll turn over in my grave.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
So any you eat at each East each day. Whatever you do I'd eat but make sure you

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
don't look to take it out with to a dog or to another. But don't leave it.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And I don't I don't need all my eyes in my eyes and all

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
this is a. I just good thing we were sixty five years so I hope

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
it helps somebody else and I don't need all my obvious to two

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
people to songs which I do like doing that I'm going to question.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And I tell you I've passed a budget where. I don't tell us to act rationally.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
But I just. But the intention my sense is that's a stupid thing to do

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
it didn't get that boot. I said but jeez is five

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
thousand people but if you're fishing if you read a story in the Bible.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
So I'm sure he's a miracle that I'm sure when I see it when I put in as I pray when

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
I don't just do it to to do it as I do is a shape over to my plate my

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
my attention is I hope that the pool day will find some pork in the

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
world

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
maybe you could see that isn't as my my God on issues

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.000
of

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
where it's at in my head just like a priest only one time as a father and when I

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
sell drugs the old has a liquor store. Joe to worry about that shit

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
when you get the two dollars you know leave you can't you can tell the cops

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
who and who also

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
know you gave it a good intention. Every descent with a bad intention. Your Hands

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
know about it so I always do when I go I know what to do it till my drug judge knows I

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
gave I gave it a good eleven intention of going to church

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
new videos I went to when I

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
was when I was up to no good and one time I saw the city actually like fuck Well

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
an apostle who fired up the fire didn't one day go and a guy every day passed

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
by and he should not sending someone. This is minute a key he had

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
to play some I put money no time. And I see a big

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
little boy up. And I shoot a guy full name but some lesson Epicurean.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And getting a little.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Used to Sumit and you have watched people. Try to

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
give people mouth to mouth and meanwhile put in a pocket.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Do they die on the floor.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And it down that lead to helping me like that man is my partner trying to you

When you voted to get off the good. You know I suppose

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
what have you all day tell you that anyway. It's only been broken by living

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
here about living in Brooklyn.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
live in Brooklyn this is my best I was I guess is again given to Churchill

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Live in important mission. Its really

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
good spirited looking and I don't know if I had been in book and I think I have

down with my underwear she would have. If you hang out

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
mother because my mother was a you disobey anon.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
discipline I have to give a shit idea she was going to discipline and I didn't get

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
home again and the last thing about governesses I love my work for the

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.000

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
percent to

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
God church and I said I did a year and at one point when Tennyson a

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
priest a young priest to do. Cavender of a church even me I give

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
two dozen for the innovation he raised me in to do it but but then he always to me should

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
mistreat meat on the holidays I decorated for

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Christmas and his volunteers and and us and a trough I said OK.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I said that preaches a lunch and then me I was God in it and him said See you

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
later Joe. And you get on Jeanette and then he

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
was there and the Opus was it goes makes you had a huge makes you had a meal

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.000
every

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
day and then he said Joe works hard as he could to produce one porch up

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
to you Should a priest don't do any I go to Joe do I maintain it and then when

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Tommy came he said to me Joe there'd be no one wants for you. I don't wish

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
to assist. If you meet a church or do American for but now environment is very

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
nearly seven large.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
So you should you know he wasn't fond of me he didn't like me and yet and then I was ten or parted on a few

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.000
no books

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
and eventually goes isn't as you go to the Julio's it loses. One of

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
A and then when he came when he was a big big PI who retired

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
recently and there's somebody come in to volunteer to say you know if you had to follow and said Joe don't

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
your

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000

And I mean you know I'm a big guy may not live on but I don't I don't want to mother my ex-wife and she

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
forgive I guess.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I sometimes doesn't like tradition but if you stage.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
You know I said one time I says I met my wife and I said to my wife and I met her she

Misty a job or your college. If you

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
want it back.

But other people will draw on

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
the net a tightening.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
said

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.000
that a

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
few years and move on and makes mistakes.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
You can't see.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Our girls

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
for. When I was young I

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
always have to make an appointment to talk to me you know years

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
and I want time.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And same time different.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Ultimate to a Twins. I want on Monday. But if I were you on a date

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
or what but I need time to get

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
I did.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I says I was saying in that kind of energy you do you know

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
you could be a man you're dealing with so I woke up. At the door and I was

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
a i.o.u like myself you know a story or scene

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
pool scene poor Wendy who are you sure are no was he was

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
persecuted Christians killed a Christian. And she's appeared to

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
him he said. So that's

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
why persecute

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
me in the Senate and a poem in a Minister

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
who he had back and he be a follower. And became a

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
great apostle. So I related to myself. And

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
I'm just saying I was a guy.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Knocking off my high horse and he brought me down below and. I go

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
which he misses five dollars per year. I don't want to be short

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
but as a final one is trying

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:52.000
to pay back my own no go and say that I mean I know you would.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
When I come back Dr and Mrs Howe says she's a baby.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And she's just a comment. Do you want to eat and. Do you have

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
So I know it and you know I never take a break and

But I'm the father I'll do I'll buy

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
that that I'll never take from anybody. And

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
just yes just wired in this and.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
I'll give it I will take the help a lot of poor people I have

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000

Does people don't have any food. To take to get whatever for thinking.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
