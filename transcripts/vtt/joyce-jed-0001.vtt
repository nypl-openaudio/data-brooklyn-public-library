00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So you are here for the rest of the white race.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For very

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
low. Over forty five

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
years came to

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the neighborhood in seventy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
seventy two. So how long would that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
be great.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Yeah yeah.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Every

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
year I grew up actually born in Brooklyn

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
by my family moved to Long Island when I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
was five or six and so I grew up on Long Island

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in Nassau County.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And then when I after I graduated from

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
college and I got married

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I decided my husband I decided to move to Brooklyn back to Brooklyn. We had

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
heard about Park Slope from cousins who were living here and I

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
think there was also at the time we were trying to figure out where we

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
wanted to live and there was a New

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
York magazine had just started publishing and they had an issue on Park Slope.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I happened to read that and it sounded so appealing because of the old architecture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the and it has seemed like a nice quality of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
life place to live so we decided to move here somewhere.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We moved when we first got here. We live our

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
heart

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
black presidents tree for and we paid I think

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
one hundred fifty dollars a month for rent over the forty

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
five years or so that I've been here I've moved pervasively farther away from

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the park because the rents kept going up and the farther away from the park. There's a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
cheaper

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
was so. But now I want to have and I'm

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
back to close the park again because I well I bought this about twenty years ago.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So if the prices weren't too bad at times. I would I mean it seemed

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
very high at the time but I paid for the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
have but as it turns out the the real estate values

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
are so crazy here that it's just gone for the skyrocket.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So I'm happy that I have my place I could buy it if

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I didn't weren't living here.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's one of those things I went through for this from other people. Yeah

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
yeah right. And I wouldn't be able to afford it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So I must've moved about seven or eight times

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
from the neighborhood I moved from between eight and a park five then I see my next places

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
between seven and eight and then between six and seven and I live on Sixth Avenue here for

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
few a couple for seven years

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and then between fifty six and.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Now as I said now I'm back to get closer to the Parkers was just

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a lucky

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
break

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
close to starting.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Just say that's a good question let me say I mean I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
guess it seemed well the way

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the neighborhood has evolved would she probably know about is the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
area when

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I met with the closer I looked the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
part we wore the fancier the buildings

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and the more

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
elegant. That's the farther away from the park I got when I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
was six Avenue between fourth and fifth

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Street for twenty years. There was. A lot of actually

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
drug dealing going

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
on in my in my environment. You

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
know on the corners and the shops on the corners a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
little small shops and it was it was

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
very kind

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of scary sometimes but you know there was so much.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I guess it was a lot of people a lot of activism and people kind of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
pressuring the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
police department kept getting more and more involved

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and it was all the crime kind of cleaned up but as

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the years went

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
on but there was I you know I remember experiencing that being a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
little nervous and then deciding that I live here anyway so that that that I had to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
just you know how

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ice kind of.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
From a distance I would see one of the one of the shots.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I think one day I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
had a flat tire and I was waiting for

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
the AAA to come and. Change my

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
tire and I noticed that this shop had hardly

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
any products in it it had very few cigarettes and very

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
few candy bars it was happened to me but a lot of people kept pulling up

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in front and getting out and going in and then coming out of bed to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
something and I mean I never you know I never asked I never got

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
myself involved in that. But

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I figured it out you know some I was to tell somebody about it they said yes

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
probably they were

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
buying drugs and that was the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
dealer and it was kind of unnerving. But when me.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I heard. Well

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
no it didn't impact on me personally nobody ever approached me

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and did anything she needed was

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
scary and.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I love to I just love the neighborhood I love the the buildings I love the architecture

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I love the friends I made I love the community and that's one of the things actually that I

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.000
wanted

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
to talk about I don't know you really get to this

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but one of the things that was so remarkable about this neighborhood when

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I moved in and I was young and I had two little

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
kids and. And they didn't have much

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
money and there was a lot

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of collective

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
cooperative things happening here so for example there was something called

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the babysitting

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
pool and I and some neighbor asked me if I

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
had joined it and I had never heard of it so

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I found out how to join it and I I joined it and it was really it was an incredible

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
thing that was forty five years ago my kids were you know very

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
young. And with what it was Have you heard anything about this

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is this OK.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You know people with children would join this

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
group and you would your name and your address and your phone number would

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
be listed and I happened

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to have someone had given custody of the old one that I of when

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I was in the event that was her old

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
copy and so there were probably maybe

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
maybe a hundred families on the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
list. And. What would happen is we

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
would call each

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
other and if we wanted to go out one night we would

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
get another parent to come and stay with our

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
kids and we pay them and little pieces of paper like tickets when

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
you joined you got a certain number of half

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
hour. Tickets are cheaper. Right because I'm so if

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
you went after three hours you would you would. Three

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Take. I guess six tickets to the person who

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
you who sat for you and then

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
you

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
would and then you would get to someone else and then you would you know

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
they could use the tickets that you paid down to get somebody to babysit for them and I

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and I would babysit for someone else and they would pay me a

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
ticket seller. Yes you did and but if you look at

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the case. You deal with

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
that right. And so and you could arrange it I mean you would you know there'd be people that you would

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
just you know get used to you kind of got to know certain people so there were probably ten families that

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I use because they live near me or I like them

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
whatever. And so we would exchange and it was it was a great way of getting to know people in

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the neighborhood and I remained friends with a lot of these people all of these years.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yeah I mean our children are gone. I've moved away but you know but they

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
kind of knew each other and they went to school

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
together over the years and. So it was really a

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
very interesting kind of collective experience and

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
now this the interesting thing is that we're now

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
starting a new group and

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
we've started this new group in Park Slope which is.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It's kind of it's called the good neighbors the Park Slope. You know if

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
you've heard of that but anyway it's an aging in place organization where

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
we're trying to we created sort of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.000
a

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
network of people who join this

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
organization and we are doing activities

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
together and going places there and sharing experiences

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
expanding who we know in the neighborhood

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
now and our goal. Probably in the future when

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
we have are less able to. Get around is to

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
have to help each other to somebody will come and shop for you if you need it or you'll go

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
with someone to the doctor if they needed and so our goal is to

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
be supportive to each other and it's called an aging in place

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of organization so we can get older here. So

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
this neighborhood has sort

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
of well you know ran a lot of the same people who are

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
in this babysitting for all are now in the good neighbors of Park Slope.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
yeah. And they're joining the neighborhood as the organization

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and I see their name on the list of who the members

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
are and so I can now go to a group and there they

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
are so it's really quite interesting neighborhood and I think it has to

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
do with the neighborhood. It has to do with people living here so long and feeling

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
so connected to it

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and just let me in I mean but people have to weigh in

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
our kids you know the way but but the parents are still here.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It's interesting to

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
know

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
some of them some of them some of them I lost touch with but then I

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
would run into them at some point or maybe at an event and say Oh I

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
DO YOU REMEMBER ME. You know and I reintroduce ourselves

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and it's which

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is depend you know who can remain friends you know friends

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
with hundreds of people over the years but

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
yet you're

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you're you're.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Well it was one. That was one source of getting to know people.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This was there were other things

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that we did as we got to know each other we

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
created a date here. Group.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So we had a large part of

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
daycare center that we called ourselves at that time I think they are into

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
some larger

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
daycare collective. We got a space at the

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
time

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I think the space changed over the years my kids grew it so I started using it

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but they did move to other spaces but they we had a space. It was a church

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
basement on presidents tree and it was quite amazing there were

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
probably a hundred. I don't remember how many

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
members we had but all the parents would help

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
out take turns watching the kids doing

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
activities and we think we we collected money so we had some part time

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
teachers already.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
But we really did it on a really low budget but it was a very interesting

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
period for the for the kids at the daycare. Then we

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
started like

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
a

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
school parent cooperate in school

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that my kids were in for a few years and all you actually had members of these

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
various the day here at the school were people that I had

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
met and that is that to me people people who

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
wanted to do things with other

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
people terms of developing organizations.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Yes Yes

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And that was an important

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:40.000
source of life.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Right

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and it's very I think I don't know if other communities are like

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but this one definitely is and it was such a terrific thing for

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
him to hear. I mean that's a great idea but it was my kids to grow up here but for me to live here

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
in my

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.000
life.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Not if I can help it I really don't want to.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Well there's no place else in real I'd rather live. I don't particularly

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
like warm tropical places. So it's

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
not like people sometimes want to go. That doesn't appeal to me.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I love the home

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I decorated.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I mean as long as I'm healthy enough I suppose I

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
could manage. So I would have

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
to live someplace else but if I had a choice I would

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
not change.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Yet

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
do three times a week with a group of

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
friends and we take a walk around early in

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
the morning. And I like to you know

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
volunteer in part of

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:26.000
area cordoned off or.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I'm

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
in the place and I really like that and I value a lot of it is

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
here that I think are very

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
valuable like the Brooklyn Museum.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.000
The

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Park.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I would be interested.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
If other people have you heard the same things from other people just like

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
people have talked about Am I the first one to bring this

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:29.000
year

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
here

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
but.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
was thinking that my friend who I met in this way could share the

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
same thing but they were going to come. So

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I least going with this piece

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
of

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
heritage collecting data.
