00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello my name is Kane admins and today I was twenty nine. And I'm here

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
met more MacArthur right Lisa

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Jackson and what happened last library for the obvious story project at

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
program Public Library three top story is an oral history project focusing on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
East New York. Why don't you tell me a little bit more about where you

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.000
found

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from you know when in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
fact what do you want

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
do you know what I remember when you first move

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you know going to school and.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You know that basically my big issue.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But I remember coming

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
here. When I came here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Actually late sixty nine. But I really didn't come to live until

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
nine seventy.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So. I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
remember. At that time I really didn't

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
have that many people here primarily you see.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Most importantly you know saying the same information why and why

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
only Shree between take him in so should I say and

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
then and then

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
by remains to

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
be one bed flat.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Surely that they are

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
your Baghdad a lot of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the street there's still a dense and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
remodelling but much of what we have in our neighborhood. In that area.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
There are eight. Deliberate you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
know people who have been here for many many

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
years have gone

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
past but I remember

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that when I first came here. My husband and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I it was such a flourishing of the new

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
lives. Vibrant place at that time they had

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
many stories. There was a restaurant that I don't know anybody.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You have a lot of Chinese takeout food on the corner. Bradford.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.000
There is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that actual sit down restaurant chain restaurant we could

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
go and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
sit there.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And when I see people sometimes about that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Because we had built a beautiful of the year to come to before

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
leaving

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
me it was.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What they call a great night we could leave from

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
our senses walk to the Corning go to develop.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You know based on this

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
year we had schools bread

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and bread bread.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Very furniture so again

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
between

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
while on the way down to brass

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
you know they pretty much on the block and that was the big furniture store

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
they sold everything right. It was

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
just much more flourish.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Here you can we don't have any more we

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
have little lounges where you could go and sit down have a drink.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Without you there. You know and it was night and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
people

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
were much more friendly back then

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and we often talk about it because

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
most everybody when you came out were talking to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
you most people don't even knowing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it when you leave dream of a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
neighborhood that some of the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
things that I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
remember. We didn't have twenty maps we had

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
one on.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The couple of the lounges we go to to go and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.000
sit

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
down and maybe have a drink or have a case

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
might be.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.000
What

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we have presently on the corner now which we

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
need. We need more substantial

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
same neighborhood but unfortunately when you're on

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
private property. You

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
know they rent to whoever they

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
want.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
had we

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
had benches in front

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
of what has

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
been.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Each one of the houses in front of the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
house they were.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
If you were working in the street you wanted to sit down you could sit

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
down and say. Yeah.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So like I said I don't want to pretty much just want to

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
juniors doing

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
it and then like I.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You know people are

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
friendlier at that time.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It was just hospital

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and we have the homeless now you know

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
the

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
answer is the face

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
before I was in

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the corner.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Right there in the car.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We had. Yet we

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
had people you know I think

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
it's not exactly.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And then they might arrive. Yet and.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I doubt. So many

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
things we

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
had

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
a good way to go. We

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
had nine news today and

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.000
you

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
know people could get that

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
paper for before they went to the

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
way more

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
friendly and we didn't have or what we have new right now.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I'm not saying

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that some of it is not beneficial to the neighborhood

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
need twenty.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Grocery store or the new name they're using coal

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Valley and valley.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
See the way that the you know if you go

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
to there being from New York.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
If you score.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
If you lately is when you win any you

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
actually contract with flying.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You know the whole

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
thing people.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
People just kept

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it. A lot

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
better and unfortunately when some

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
people unable to cope with things

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
change and right. We see the furniture store all of that

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
with you know different just so in a laundromat and all

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that that is how they want houses

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
here so people who live here in

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the morning

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
have one round the corner so that they you know they're not

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
alone in a

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
restaurant while now there were two

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
levels saying maybe you. Two hundred to one on

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the corner of their member when they had a two or three a one on

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
each lane or

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
all they

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
have and it was just so

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
different and like I said people were much more friendly and even

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
when did you moving

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
moving even.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
People is so much more friendly than a

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
neighborhood really was a neighborhood where you hear about that village.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Right. That's what I'm even though it's about

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
like when I went to were thinking

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
how

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
did this all right

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
for him

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
her And you know there was no hassle or anything like that you know

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the new go have a case might

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
be and se but for one

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
another

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
place and I think I'm a desolate that you know.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
This is not the area. You know it's really not the

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
end I guess it's a situation like people said well you know

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
things change and I'm not going to change the place

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
changes in a

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
hive way but if that changes in

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
a positive way and it's just holding together.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.000
To do

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
why then what is the purpose of your change and

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
neighborhood should change.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
They then

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
need. If I'm horribly and I want to

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
go to Home Depot. I'll be able to go around corners and go.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You know there's one down around big man you know but whatever

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I'm saying we're still.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
You know we have a wider now because we're

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
related to the.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You know the you know that kind of business go see you know you go to the Klan.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And yet. All of that as for it we actually go out

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of breath and

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
this

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
is yet

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Not just you. Yeah

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but after the blackout. They had so

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
much looting. They never were able

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to come back negative fact they needed a small store and

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that and that didn't work and eventually they just moved

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
out and

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
we add anything in

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
here

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
DAV they already sold the movie theater with out of

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
this

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
is

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
really the most training

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
when how much money down flat.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They probably didn't do the Biltmore the

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
year and of course you know yes pay if you go and see

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that side and there is none if they get it because they will lie

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
down with you know everybody wants to see that big fight.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
You know. A lot of people couldn't get out of the driveway

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
close to call eyes or a

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
line and be a net that such a big

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
fat people came from all over.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
So we had which we call a traffic jam here and

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
what happened

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
was after the role of the people got so excited.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
When they were coming out they brought the lady the female

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
the bill.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The they broke the two doors. You know like

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
the glass door as they come out from the theater and she was

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
so upset and she said you know what I think this class still one at a

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
time and she said it again

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and that became the now right. When I started going

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
down. You would.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Sure but what happened in the state is stayed

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
until she gave it up and then started

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
going down the deal is just a big dog because nothing was

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
happening and a toilet down and then just by

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.000
inches

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
there waiting for a developer or somebody to come in

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to do something with it a long time for several

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
years and then the

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
property history that when you had a

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
fire that was all taken down. So here now we

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
are stuck with it and the

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
tree and the lot on the other side with the furniture store.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
What is presently both it and them when they're

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
loading acid in bread. One of the black

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
out and then looting it down

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
you know she said many

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
neighborhoods or little we had a

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
school supply store around the corner where in the fantasy we're going to

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
be fit and. They took out

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
that. They say.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's America and America. Right because if

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
they travel. They were solely taking steps.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
They trampled the person to that right

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
away. So people were it

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
was OK that they were walking down the street with a washing

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
machine act and people the want to

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
refrigerator. You know every word you

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
know we were in the wrong

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and then you talking about people more concerned

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
with what. After their property they

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.000
were

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
friendly that really was tough.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
That was the beginning of the now. For

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
our neighborhood and you might say most New York because then they just took

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
it all away to the

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
right. They made the bird out

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
of. All of

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that there is a man down around

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
the corner

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000
at Bravo or whichever one there one knew.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
That story changed names about four or

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
five times but that gentleman

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
that Benjamin Moore paint

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
still

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and he you know people used to go for

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.000
the few little things that.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
He was about the only thing

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
left and he tried to do it.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
You know.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
People listen to it.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And I was amazed that he was able to say because

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
there was

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
just so

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
go away.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Yeah he said.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
From

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
basically.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
OK the church out

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
for community. Use to be

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
a street.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
You also have the rest right.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Because it has a staff that

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
beautiful really play a you could also go there

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
have been three they have and they are yes

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
over the years like. You say probably after that.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
They all are a big

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
cage and little

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
club. Until they went and they used to have

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
this is called the The chicken place

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
of chicken the last delight.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Belles was live and that of course to

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
change

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
factor. You also had another

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
movie

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
theater

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
but it was actually the movie The pit bull.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Let's say going back

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
to the midst of a yeah

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
you really is that X. rated that

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
she was it was always actually.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I added which is that what

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
shirts still have that sisters on Saturday.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Releasing those that live.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Yes So it was that was the church but it used to

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
be part of school.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So those are the little things I remember we had

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
those hospitals that we had them to live

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
across from. The story to

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
say was that this became active but

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
it was first and OK you had a little

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
boy with a nappy

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and. We used to

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
have a lot of

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
spillage even in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Norway and then.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And then in Africa with the name of the system within

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
the but they had stories to tell to

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
day.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I can't get used to the fact that it is related.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
You know now that the movie has gotten about we talking about horses.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
We have what we have was.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And it was a developing

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
story yet. The big thing they had to

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
tell them as they do is that

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
they turned it

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
off and I think people would be down the years and

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
they would buy that at

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
last you

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
know and people used to talk about it I remember the pain

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
their salaries and not like you know later on.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Things happened has always been

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
a popular place that people refer

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
to their remember. That

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.000
means

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
that you have. I actually went to see it

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
as full of a lot of.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
What I was told about. Three

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
was when they were still usable do nothing but rolled over

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.000
in the bowl of

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
water and so it

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
is people without

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
the will to live so it was a

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
scale. Basically still

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
very very powerful. Yes when

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
they had my candy or that.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Street

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
also then so they're going to

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
say the

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
name of stable

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
where all the road from without

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
the I'll talk about gold. We need

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
the

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
reality. But it isn't been laden

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
with all that you see that

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
know that God

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
is God reached

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
at Langley you will find me.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
So what happens is alright city when the first thing.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.000
When you with all

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
the cynicism

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
mocking a lot of people saying why are

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
you so much for a in.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
My seat and checking out. Now

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
when in the quest to lose weight for so many years. You

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
know what they did

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
this or that all over the road.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So when they are sorry to be in a lot of people don't talk

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
about that.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
When you use the gold and then you will get a funny.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
This is after the bill is already on top.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
So you get the slow flight and they have a real

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
bad problem and brand

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
building infestation roaches in

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
my boat out of saying I want to

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
live there but you know it's in the area

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
that he tells me about the time that

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
you ride to the

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
you know the and or the factory

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
where at the time

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
that the truck would come

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
through and they had a lot coming from the window.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Most of these are just to level.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
They

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
would take like let's say we doing

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
silly like that maybe you need to do is leave.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
The main

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
the the front of the jacket or

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
whatever coming from the

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
wind and the truck comes through and they

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
would say the did whatever they

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.000
had

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
completed whatever they would send it down the road

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.000
and

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
the person with the truck with take

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
their receipt that and then they would send him up another back to the

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
wind and they were duly peace

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
for that long before

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I came here. You know.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
I had this issue

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
that said you know

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
we're talking imagine growth coming out of the window like

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Oh right yeah all of that but also the.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
The movie house that was very popular they said

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
and said I think you're

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
a big movie and a lot of the talk.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
They don't

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
believe

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Ralph but it is

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
very

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
close

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
call they hear people talk

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
about that I could

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
never actually

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
land

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
or what have you had this was back

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
in the day James Brown to pig

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
out to be a good

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.000
and

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
human man great

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
that he

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
did that when I used to be affiliated.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And you know when I come you know.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
So when

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
he came to pick

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
the

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
right thing

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
in

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
the edit. So I really have any

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
ammo with my first

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
choices here refer to

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Brooklyn going to

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
stick

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
to the many words

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
that you know

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
uses that country

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
and for

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
that man

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
that he

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
would tell you have. Goes

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
all the talk

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
about that

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
no that we know

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
you have to

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
get the ball with me. So

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
this

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
was to the right where we have

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
right now.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Place

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
the year across the street by

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:43.000
street

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
name because the wallet is even we used to

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
bury the Black Berry a grand I

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
mean

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
sure you know that

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
the

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000
web.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
No longer around.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
But

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Ed Brown

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
was the

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
C.E.O. But what happened

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
was when

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
making money for

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
a different neighborhood

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
where

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
they were

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
giving then more money than they were

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
giving you

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
right

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
it was never a separate issue.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
It became a separation when. And they

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
said

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
that they wanted to be given more

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000
than

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
that around

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
speaking if you look at

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.000
it with the New York.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Going to get to

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
leave.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
think the stand was now

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
here they don't know

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
really New York.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Certain who for whatever reason.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
There's more negativity.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Which

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
people really don't want to live in the papers and

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000
the beautiful par.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Bad Reputation.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
But

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
first here.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
What about.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
They grow and.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Never come back or whatever the case. Allen

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
hole

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
that some form of fashion could be

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
some kind of fish. To it so that

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
they

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
know more of their

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
preferences once represented

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
and hopefully in the future will continue to

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
represent bring us back to where we

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
were and maybe it would teach

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
them to

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
respect and care for the community a lot

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
better than I know there's not much for them to do

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
the you know we need more that you know so I want to go

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
and talk about

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
the recreation of the men here we need.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
It's coming but it's not here.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
I just feel

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
like you need seven street shows and

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
big

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
sell. Or what have you

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
maybe to maybe use utilize a lot of Barry.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And maybe have sessions and say hey you know come to the

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
library and learn about Lee live.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
You know but they have to be there if you start. You need

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
to go. They're not going to come in till they see that you're

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
really good about it and it's not like a one time thing

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
because these kids need to know

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
about you

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
know they need to be

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
taught. Community.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Here they

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:29.000
make

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.000
you

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:43.000
think

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.000
you

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
may.
