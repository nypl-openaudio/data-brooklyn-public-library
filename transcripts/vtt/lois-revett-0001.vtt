00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So there's lawyers here really good that Greenpoint branch of the Berkeley goes library for our streets are stories

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and his name was Lois wrote that for that city this every

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
night the city of Los tell me all about

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the Clinton

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you know about Brooklyn. Well if you go back I may need to hear today.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I live with more on the Lower East Side. And

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
then migrated to various parts of Brooklyn where my mom and my

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
father took

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
me and the different areas that I lived

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in different stories you know. It was a different

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
time when I was younger growing up. I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
was born right

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
after I was one hundred thirty three right

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
after the stock market crash and President Roosevelt was getting

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
everybody back into the things building things and getting people to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
work it was a different time people were poor but they got together

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and there were times when people didn't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
have an apartment anymore or a home because

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
they didn't have the money in the neighbors got

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
together and made a party in the street just a party they

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
cooked they sold. And all the proceeds went to the family who needed it

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
most and then there were other

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
times when we hosted payroll parties for young men that were going overseas.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You know it was a sad time but it was a good time but the sad time with some of them that became back.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But I don't want to dwell on misery and wonder Well I'm a nice time you know it was

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
nice people got together people were friendly you get from your fire state you wouldn't have to worry

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
about anybody bothering you. Nobody called you any dirty names you know.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
was well yeah. If you had. I think again depressed

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and it was depressed and say I hate Bobby Jones I don't like Bobby Jones

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but it was Bobby not the Jones family that you know

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
why and then that would time go all right and growing up I'm

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
going around. I used to root for the Brooklyn

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Dodgers honestly after stabbing flap rice

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and trying to hide and sometimes I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
couldn't get enough money to get a ticket with like the five sixty five cents but was an addict.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So we my girlfriend and I made friends with one of the attendance

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in the L. and he would seek us and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
said again we go there like saying maybe after the second or third inning and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
bang on the roll down

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
door. And then he pulled it all the way up and we need again we get into the more case

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
or nothing. Or we would stand outside I'm Vesper Davin

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
you there was a gas gas station

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
there and the boys was with there

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
are a lobster to hit a homerun. I mean if they record a home

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
run ball and was from one of the Brooklyn Dodgers you would bring a chance to retire

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
into. And they would even give you a ticket or they let

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
you get into the game. That's how it's almost you know that sneaking in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
acting but it was it was a different time and we used to go

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to after the ball of bang it was a bowling alley right.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Ready for some devolving alley flapper standing in most of the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
ball play just to go in there and hang out after it. You know conned out some of them went to a bar

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but you know the younger ones went there.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Then we went to Empire roller

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
rink and we roller skate and would be over

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
there with some of the dodges and we would have fun

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but it was a different time it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
was I would like. Go back to that time when you're

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
doing going all day. Let me see I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
was in my first thought of knowing about baseball when bat eight nine years old.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And I had to be like thirteen fourteen when I least making it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
now twelve thirteen my carpets and I sneaking into the games and going on for

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Sam showing the case of morals and I had a favorite baseball player his name

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
was Peewee

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Reese and we had a club at

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Brooklyn Dodger club. I was Pee Wee Reese she was caught my girlfriend. Was caught for

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
relatives

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and we were all there and at that particular game

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
when that Jackie Robinson play for the first time a black

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
player ever to play

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
baseball and he played in Ebbets Field and it was a shame what they did to him they thought of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
going to make it is an apples and everything in bowling

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
him and all he wanted to do was play baseball which he wanted in which we

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
enjoyed by the new it yet the people were crazy.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And they just they didn't care you know I'll call foul language is stuff like

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that but he was very reserved and he was

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
a very very sweet

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
person. And. Usually before the game or after the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
game you can get an autograph from him he would no matter what they did to him you can get

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an autograph from him. And he wouldn't say

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
anything bad but. It

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
was

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a different a different time. Now sometimes there's a lot of a swell place I would say not.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Not still not to good things about them you know. But. Time to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
a different. Also when I was younger I said that my grandparents lived on

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the Lower East Side.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
My grandfather was a janitor. I'm one of the buildings on Clinton

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Street. And my mom used to take

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the trolley car so he would and I don't get the wings of our bridge

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and go to see him get off and see him and he would tell me stories

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and there was this one particular

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
story that always stayed in my mind that years and years ago there was

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
a Jewish gangsta name Bugsy Siegel

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and some reason why they used to sit on the stoop where

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
my grandfather was the janitor could study and make Roman now.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And he would be with his friends and they would be screaming and yelling

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and doing all crazy things on my program follow them and go

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
crazy doing that and getting him out of there and a couple

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
of times he would tell my mother tell

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
me tell them young kind of being young got enough. You're going to be and I

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
should have waited in line he says has said he was that he was a gangster Knight tell my mum and that's

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
a little bit I know that my father was going to know once and didn't call me and to

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
me that it was it was funny and then that

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
was trying to think that to drive me crazy just

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
one

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
actor that my mom used to go over here to the Henry Stu settlement and they used

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to have dances I understand they night. And my mother would go there

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and there was this one good looking guy my mother told me

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that he would have to dance and my mom liked to dance that he did OK show you know if you don't

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
dance and Haro sister came over and her sister says

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Why who are you dancing with to my love this that I don't know he asked me to

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
dance and I want to do it so I think. Later on my mom

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
found out he became a movie star.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I can't think his name was tall dark

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
looking and he just he played in

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
musicals the money made him why he became.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
They had a gangster roles as you know not too good to remember any of the movies

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
they do remember any of the movies and that isn't always this going. This is one of

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
those long term memories of going going going but

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I could see his face I really could see his face.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And he reminded my mom a little bit about Rudolph

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Valentino the sheik that let's see let's dive in film star OK and

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
all the women used to go crazy you know but my mother God rest his

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
soul was had a favorite favorite

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
was

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000
first

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
me.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And he played in a few movies good looking and.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I can't think of it but anyway my mom was nuts about him.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You can say anything bad about him.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
No. After he passed away.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You know right away and yes you passed away. And they did this show on

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
television about some of these actors and what this that's

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
this sexual references were and it turned out that he

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
was gay that only with gay but he died of some kind of an

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
illness

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
which was that time. Right you

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
know. One of Tyrone Power.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
OK

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
OK And my mom was than him but I

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
have that you haven't even heard now on the number we

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
which is going number

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
really well when she found out that he passed away. And what were they were

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
saying I'm adamant he did sell Na-Na Na-Na she refused to believe that and I said you know my just

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
like rock I said. But you need a rack of them with eating. You know.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But you know that's how I said I mean a lot of things growing

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
up different parts you know what were the different neighborhoods that you grew up and. OK I

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
grew up on through Bhavin you OK with the only Jewish girl in

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the competency in All Saints Church.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And used to go to dances over

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
there used even though I was Jewish I would go to midnight

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
mass with my friends so I ran services for Easter.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And my mom didn't like it but my girlfriends and their parents you know liked

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it and I lived there for a while

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and then I moved

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
to East New York. But then I didn't like East New York at that time

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
how brazen I was about what I would get

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
later about I was about thirteen and then I came

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
back

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to he was thirteen when when you. You know. It with your family

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
or you know well my mom and then when we came back

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and because we had been there before and everything you

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
know on it was not something happened it was a nice little place.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And then later on I met my husband and I got married and moved away from there.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So women went to New York to go live

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
back there again but then later mining came back and

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
we moved back into Brooklyn with the Marines where I've been living

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
in was boarding the same building for well thirty as a result of an

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
uprising over thirty S. and things have changed.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You know it's not like it used

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I lived on Hooper street Hooper yet Cooper name

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
awfully couple of times

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and. That was a neighborhood that you

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000

Yeah. But now you couldn't go there. Now you can't afford to live there.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
That's everything that's turned around and it's just the streets.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I don't know if they getting better or not but I kind of we stand with the state saying what is it that

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
togetherness. You know not everybody is out for themselves. You

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
You know and nobody everybody now was for themselves you know later for you. You know.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Get a good

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
job you get online help if you have somebody most a money that maybe one

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that needs a job. Nobody helps. Nobody books anymore it's all for

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
one and you. And that's it. And that's what bothers me

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
because I brought my kids up to my mom.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
God bless her she always used to say to me when you're growing up

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
talk to somebody say hello how are you. How do you

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
feel this you never know when you're going to need those

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
people and the fact that you're saying hello nothing comes out of your pocket.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's free and you'd be surprised to help you. Yes I get help with this Walker.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
People come from They'll see me and they know I'm I've got they run right to the door and open up the door.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is what reminds me of how it was when I was

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
killing people help

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
people to still have relationships with some of your neighbors and there is even there's a

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
lawyer part of my neighbor and I my granddaughter came a couple of times and she

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
about eight nine years old she says Grandma. Let's go see where you live.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I said. I don't know. You don't know let's go see Ray you know. And we took

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the car only drawled out this route back and you know and I've been doing small

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
between ripple and while about. The house

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I lived in was no longer there was torn down was a

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
lot of what was there that

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
day and all the buildings around there that I

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
could go to like they built on Broadway.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
They built these Normandy park projects houses very

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
expensive and that's where we used to hang happy used to be a viral with a cause of

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Amman Curly's.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And we used to go there and have the parties with us all just to go after and to go

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
overseas and

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
then we party I would act and that's not there anymore. You know. So lots of

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
things are gone from there to about of our you went to the big dad's

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
gone so what was that call that was now we can go

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
to the bar we go to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the roller rink Freddie recessions valving alley the bowling alley and

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Empire mojo right.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And Jackie Robinson ever come out of any of those years of the

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
mill that was a time where it was dangerous for

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
him because people didn't you know black this black that you know all

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the names that tickled him. It was

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
the period for his life a couple times you know. So he didn't

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
go but all the other ones we call roll rap

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Branca you see Johnny jog and Sendai newcomer

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
ICAP analysis picture that was one of them was one instance and we used to

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.000
hang

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
out with a ballplayer. And he's dead now.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Raf

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
kind of used to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates and I was there one day and I was looking for your

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I don't know what. As all know I was graduating from junior high and I wanted to get an

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
autograph and he said I don't give autographs to

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
girls and I said you're going to be starry and he said

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Why so

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
well because girls are the backbone of the world the country. You know

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I says of what simple girls you wouldn't be. So he said I don't give

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
girls autographs girls should be worrying about baseball things but a house

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
so I said to him it's the kind you may be a nice guy

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
but what's going to happen today. If you're not going to get on base.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
You're not going to get a base hit you not going to get a homerun you're not going to be based

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
on ball. You're going to go up one two three is that all nine innings you could be sitting

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
on the

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
bench and he was ready which And I said

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
yeah. And we went home

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and I came home and I listen to the radio I turn the radio on

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and to hear one thing and he didn't get he was get non-base

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that all.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So I called up my girlfriend I told what happened she said that's going to mar was she we could see him.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
The next day we didn't go. They were playing the three games that was the day the

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
day after we went down there.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And we saw him and he saw me I

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
said you're still not giving autographs The girls share our what

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and I said to my girlfriends Sandy said to him you know miss the kind of we thought you were going

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I got you know the fact that you didn't even get

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
on on the real and you're still being a nasty man.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So he says.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
All right. Jimmy I'll give you your autograph I says you

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
know something I don't want to snap. US The way I want

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
to when he's like them out of the ice and then I want to you know I

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
was worried that you know my things

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
do develop a final one of this. Would you like that here any

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
minute now that I'm going to my plan to go to the game.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Yeah go some of the games and watch it on television. If I can avoid any negative I can go to

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
again I go to cycles on cycle because I'm in Miami the Brooklyn Dodgers. Yeah you

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
know and that's you know that's it I love baseball baseball and

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
football and I get this way a basketball. Because

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
when I was in high school I was on the cheering

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
squad team never won a

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
game a question that the hate was so

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
bad and I swore after that after that I get that one semester there where I was

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I'm not going to be a base cheering on either squad anymore.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I said I hate basketball. It's my team in high school taught me to hate

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that yeah

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
yeah because I never won and never won a game LEGO all but

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Travis deficit all these Brooklyn automotive all the

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
take place to go for a

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
ball and they number one again.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
So I hated this world and you know I have a digression

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
team with their lives they also share with me about

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
about living in Brooklyn. I think most of most of it

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
is I really don't like to see gentrification

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
some parts. I

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
mean I would like to have had

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
it may be tapered off when it used to be

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
good times to change you know

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
and

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I still like to go back every once in a while I think back to what used

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
to be.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And there's another little story when I was living on Hooper street. I

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
don't know you know going into wrestling. But it was a

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
wrestling star now he was world wrestling champ. Pedro

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Morales when I lived on Hope

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Street

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
his sister and brother in law was the

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
old and he stayed with them and couldn't speak English.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Because the

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000

try you get maybe ten dollars if you fall down

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
in fifteen dollars if you win it was fixed it really was six.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
OK what he did

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
that he did that and later on he became more of a

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000

You've got this on the station with trains go this way that's what they used is

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
a little little opening all in there and what they used to have over

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
there was a trial because coming in and the trolley cars comment and

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
then they turn around to go war earlier man and then they go. Have died that.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
They had no walls and nothing they had in the summertime they had bars

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
on the windows and they had shades. That was your recognition ing you

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
That's all it went all over the borough to do or did you write a lot.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Yeah five cents five

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000

you would find the guys with the jelly apples

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
and jelly Apple Apple right into the hot jelly and

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
you get that and they do it with a cup and that piece is a

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
coconut and jelly jelly coconut. So it's like a candy

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
apple two cents three cents depends on the people

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.000
saying much but that was good.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
It's nice. I don't go to Coney Island in less than. Go to Brighton Beach

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
and my aunt lived in Brighton Beach and we go there

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and go to my mama gorge all the stores and buy all

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
of the food although there are certain things that the Russians got the right to it

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
was like you like a blend. Or some voice just something you

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
know something that would make meat pie and take it home.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
You know because that's like the Heritage guys we got we got German Russian

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and Hungary and and. And I'm

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.000
like yeah. In your family.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
We ate all those things out there it was nice you know you made me go down to memory lane and wishing that

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I was really back here again. Because their dealings

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
were so

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
different when I was growing up by all of them all this is not the thing you guys didn't

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
know I don't know if anybody of them. Remember it. But you didn't just go to the movies when

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
you went to New York you went to a stage show.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
OK The movie just had the oh the Brooklyn Paramount with the press twice.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
To have class A natural as a

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
guest performer and people used to draw apples intimated that he was

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
a designer. They didn't say but getting back

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
what maker he was just getting a little thing any had his

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
faults high and you could see him forgot about you know he had a pretty good voice but I

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
think yes when I was Tony Bennett and I did like.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Why the game that's in New York they had the stage shows you had the Strand. D.N.A. You had a

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
New York. Hair my you had

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
gone the Roxy to Fox and they would show

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
movies and a stage show and after the movie was over.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
You get a van a

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
store. Desi

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Arnaz man. Tony Bennett you know am I talking that

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I'm

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
sure is man. Many man and what they

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
would do it they would play and they would have comedians they would have fingers they would have all those

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
things and

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
then later on it would go go away and then them. You know the

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
second set would

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
come and that's when I used the same to say I used to sneak out of

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
school say I would go to the

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000

I need my girlfriend and go to the. Well that's a good time I

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
got

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I got caught by one of my teachers but I got all the details and

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
he was taken aback and me he was going to do did you hello.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
that I was this is that it was. When we went back to school and then they would every time he'd seen

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
me that I had a lot of ideas that and in that so I'm the

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
most the type that's that's how it was I'm like and I miss

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
that I miss the camaraderie. You know

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
the togetherness between teachers and students. Not

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
the N.B.A. or the hate or anything else. You neighbor S. jealousy I.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
People were different and you know you had all types

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
of you know. Spanish. I went to a lot of

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Indian weddings.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I went to a Muslim wedding. I went to a Chinese wedding I went to a Chinese

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
funeral because all these people we were always like the League of Nations where I

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
live you know and especially going to school and

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.000
high

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
school and you got. These people

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
and you know you got to mingle with them and know the

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
things and I I had made the thing that I wanted all knowing all about other people's religion.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
That's what I was worried about and at that particular time I think I know more about

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
the Catholic people's religion then the Catholic people that because

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I went after it in earnest I want to know why you celebrate

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
this why you do that and just like I expected my girlfriend to learn

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
about my religion but she didn't do it. Did you learn about all this religion

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
just from talking to just run or do some You're going like I said I was the only Jewish girl a convict her

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
nanny and I knew a lot of people

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
and in fact one time was very very sad and I did among bacteria in

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
that it was

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
midnight mass and one of my

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
friends member of the family was

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
I don't my side of the cloth I just stay in the back the last seat in the back

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
and I used to pray as I own you know nothing the SAMs and everything

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
else because I knew that I knew was bothering him and why I could say in

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Latin what this one particular Midnight Mass I lent him

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
was supposed to be to

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
have my girlfriend and her family you know by

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
prayer and I was sitting down minding my own business

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
and this woman

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
that was a week of fava Lou. He came and he

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
was doing sermon and this woman stood up and she said she doesn't want

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
to stay doesn't want to sit here. While the heathen is in the

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.000
church

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and. What he's And what he's a new You're

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
talking about so she says he's an

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
end here. And you have to get her out and I'm not going to sit here so he

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
can baffle Sapulpa excuse myself.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Digging down from the point but when all this to her and that's what I'm talking

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
about and she pointed to me and he

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
said she thought Cheney is all what do you pointing at her for what funny

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
that she Drazen she does them a lot and yet she still

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
wish he looked at

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
her and he said yes.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And go up there and buy you all that she demanded across

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
that he was Jewish too. So if you come to see him.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
You come and if you don't mind. Now I want you to

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
leave. Just tell. How did you

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.000
know which

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
is because I know that nations a know those in

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
little you know

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
their first time I saw her when she saw me because I used

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
to going to this other little section church and I go.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
My name I'm back you know long bacteria again never because I

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
was doing a good thing for somebody. And she turned it

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
into a nasty

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
thing and I felt like the church was tainted after a while I

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.000
just

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
didn't know the priest time used to come to my half and tell come

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
to see me and tell my mom that she's

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
my mother said look I don't approve of her going to church.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
OK Because I know deep down you people are trying to convert her. Did

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
you tell them.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
She said this is hard decision. She said she was

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
hurt very badly and she doesn't want to go there

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
again that's how it ended here

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
she hurt me. Do you really

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
or to go up to sunrise services. I could have been in

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
bed but I ran I went to go show respect for my friends.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
You know that's how I learned a lot about those other people's religions all

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
and going to the weddings because once when I'm a people person.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000
dating

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
is that if I could I would
