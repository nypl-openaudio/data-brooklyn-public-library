and so thank you for joining us now you're welcome. Where were you

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
born I was born in Kristiansand Norway. It's a pretty big town and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I forget how many thousands of people

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but I was born there and I lived there until I was three and a half and then my

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
father was already over here so my brother my mother myself we took a plane

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I think with a propeller Icelandic plane I don't know how many hours it took like twenty four

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
hours I think me two steps one in Iceland and they be one in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Newfoundland and my aunt and uncle they had already they were living here they

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
were working for the new My uncle worked for the new each in the consulate.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So they met us at the airport and and then that yes

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
remark years old I moved to at that time it was called Bay Ridge Brooklyn now it's called Sunset Park.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And fifty first Street between seventh and eighth we lived there for ten years eight

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
years but and then we were to sixtieth Street.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I lived in that whole area now money six

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
streets you know like Florida now in sixty years I've lived like

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
within they reach Sunset Park Dyker Heights on the border.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yeah. So that's where I started F. with your father also from Scandinavia. Yeah.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My father was a region carpenter over here yeah.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And what did your mother do my mother when she first came over here

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
she. She and my aunt they took turns they because they had

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
all had kids so we took turns cleaning they cleaned some houses for people in the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
neighborhood and so my aunts would go on some days and my cousin was the same age as me and she had an

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
older brother and I had an older brother so they they work it out so that the days when my

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
aunt was working my mother was on with the kids and vice

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
versa. I remember with my cousin and I. They was like. Well done the.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Net learns about Liberace because my cousin used to play the piano and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
he was on the he was on the T.V. in the mornings I think. And one

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
memorable thing I remember it at my aunt's house when I stayed there with my

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
cousin fifty second Street and they were the super She was the super in this building I don't know

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
how many apartments. But. She was on the second floor and so I guess I was

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.000
about

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to buy my cousin the same age five years old and in the back of the house it was fenced in

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and there was a little yard and a big tree in the back and on the lower branch they had

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
a an old tire with their I don't know what was used to the for the rope

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to swing so it was of the hand they swing recycling you know.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And so I remember my answer when it was time for lunch she brought

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the bucket out from.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
From the window from the second floor and she had a rope on it and she made like sandwiches and some kind

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of drinks for us and. Some fruit or something sent it down

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
on that on the thing for us in that I thought that was so clever like at that time those that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
stuck in my mind I said oh that's a creative. You know to so go and down and bring us a lunch you just like

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to know out the window when the bucket was a little ring and brought it down.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So that's one of memorable moments that I recall but

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
then sadly they

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
moved to Maryland and. That's two years later after we had arrived

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
so that was sad because I was very close to my chest.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Yeah but Brooklyn. I was thinking to this project how it's changed so much in those

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
years because that Eighth

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Avenue in Brooklyn now is considered Chinatown Little You have all of everything is Chinese

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
there when we came sixty years ago everything was new each and they're changed so much so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I was remembering all the different. The bakeries down there and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the there was like two big reason a deadly Olson's and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Paterson's and there was that sons of Norway which is I guess kind of like a new Egypt

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
version of an ice a Columbus you know but. Region sons of Norway

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and where else was there was a bike and we can buy music

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Viking store on fifty seventh and then my friend went to school with and six grades.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Our father had the Anderson fish store right across the street.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So when I look back now and then I did do a book on it a few years ago called that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
scarce Boulevard left coast is left in the region stew and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
so they that they referred to that a fabulous new we can still do

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and so that was transformed so I'm wondering to myself that was

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
like maybe thirty years ago. This is started changing around.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'm thinking to myself I wonder what that's going to be like another thirty or forty years from now.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But I don't know maybe it will stay Chinatown because it seems like.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Like Chinatown downtown Manhattan that a state like Chinatown for so maybe the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Chinese artists asked to like pack up and move away as the new regions and other nationalities were I

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
don't know but anyway I have a lot of good memories from then have new

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and you see what else I wrote down I wrote

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
some I wrote down the names that I could remember of a new region stories on

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
a new I wrote down and I remember there was an eighteen page

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
on was forty eight to forty one street in Eighth Avenue and in the old dainty they said

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that used the coffee beans just becoming a bag and they used to ground it for you right

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
there and they saw that like when you finish and they put it back in the bag.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It smelled so good I remember that a P. coffee but now it's only in the Gore

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
may places where they have the blessings they used to do that all the time a G.P. a

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
coffee and let's see the story of remember Fredrickson hog

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and that was the meat store on a

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
new. And then they moved to Fifth Avenue eventually but then they change the name to Sussex

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and handsome but that's yeah. Eventually every single from Asia have you to visit

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
them you. And now I think they still have a line up they still have a parade every year

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that goes on thirty. And you. Seventy from a parade.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Reachin Constitution Day parade even of a

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
neighbor who can constituency smaller and

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
smaller it's still going on I don't have how much longer of us still the neighborhood

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
changes so there's still a little bit of No we

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
just left in the neighborhood but not too much. Sadly the Nordic Delic

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
deli closed last January January fifth two thousand and fifteen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They were also left for thirty years that was the last of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the Norwegian source in trying to set the place to get like dinners to

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
go say at you know there's a.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
You know everything has to change but it's sunset when you look back is it the business.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Everyone from the culture like kind of moved elsewhere

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and or with ever. You

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
know what I actually see the Nordic

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
really well like that lobster. Left cares that I said they have

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
this like a stew that every like Usually that it started out with being like

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
leftovers you put it in but then at the end people bought you know specifically to make the leg scarce.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They have that and then they have this potato dumpling. That you could buy there and

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.000
then they

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
had the meatballs you know in the region balls or Swedish meatballs they call

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
them and. Oh they

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
had I don't know

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
every Christmas they used to make all these batches of knowledge and cookies at that store that people used to

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
come from all over

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
just to get them at the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
holidays Hong Kong which was like an ice cream

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
cone you could fill it with something and be just have a plane.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So you get all that stuff there and you could buy stuff

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
from the chocolates you know from Norway

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and and fish a fish cakes from Norway and whatever

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
like packaging a piece in soups and stuff like that ready made process from

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
knowing you could buy just the

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
store here. Your favorite childhood

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
activity here. Let's see.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I remember going to Sunset Park to school but I don't know if it was a favorite but

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I do have a go when there is very crowded everybody gets a blast and whatever but

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that was before

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
air conditioning you know really people didn't have it back then so I was just to go there and cool

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
off to Sunset Park the forty forty seventh Street in seventh

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
heaven.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Yeah they all I did take a picture of it. From the neighbor

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
used to love like when I was little I remember playing with horses like that real horses blast

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
sources any kind of horse or tending we were horses like used to put a rope around it you

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
know like a horse and so for some reason I think. There

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
was a guy

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that came around I guess just to have your photo taken you know they used it. That was they got your mother

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
or whatever they said you want take picture on a horse so I guess it was popular because I don't know how much they charge at

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that time the scholars I guess. You got your picture. And. And so

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I think it was my first time on a horse I think I must be about five at that time and.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And I was remember. I think I've had I don't know what I think about it now I think is how it was the plied

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
by the guy who was there had the horse and all the family has you know I

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
think about it I probably got license from the Christmas

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.000
tree

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
in the cowboy hat.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But yeah that was and then

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I I finally got to go I remember writing I was twelve I guess I was from

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
some seven years later my friend and

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I went to take a bus and we went to Staten Island to float

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
like clothes like stables which is still there today I

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
think we took the bus from Brooklyn to

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
there although I guess they had some places in Brooklyn but I was that was and

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that was an experience you've got to be got to gallop to try and walk you

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
know started up so that was an exciting twelve. Money made it on

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
a real horse. To go to school in the area.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Yes first started out first grade.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
P.S. ninety four on fifty's street and fifty first Street in six seven you still there out.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Yeah I guess they're all still there then we moved my last year

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
or sixth grade we moved to.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
From fifty three to sixty a street so then I went to P.S. one o five on fifty eighth

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway for my sixth grade and they went to Pershing Junior

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
High School which is on forty ninth Street and ninth Devon you. And for Hamilton High School.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
That I went to Hunter for a while for three years and I just left I couldn't

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
make up my mind but I want to do so I left after three years and then went back.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And then I worked in an office for.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I guess that thirty years

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and now I'm

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
retires turn sixty five in a couple of months so.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Looking forward to get my half there I said to Brenda.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I have fare on the subway in buses that will be nice that's one of the advantages of getting a little

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.000
older

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and yeah. Is there anything else or

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
ones for say

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
now. Oh yes when I first came over here my first slice of pizza.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.000
My

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
cousin she was born here you know she went back to Norway since you know like the reversal.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But anyway so she was going to introduce me to

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
pizza fifty third Street and Fifth Avenue King's pizzeria which she lived on

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
fifty second Street near Fifth and that place is still there today and this is like in one

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
hundred fifty five fifty six. And so she started me off with she had the pizza

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and she gave me the cross like that that

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
was broke me into that because we were used to that pizza you know in Norway. So

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it didn't take me long before I liked it you know to this day I love that pizza so.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
But it's funny that that place is still around after sixty years you know that King's pizzeria

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Yeah yeah.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
If you. Things are still there. All these places here that I've

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
mentioned. They've all closed down like the deer has the Atlantic restaurant.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
People used to go that was like a great bargain.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
They've got all this food and we did meatballs and potatoes and.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
We called Asda stewing which was like to do the math.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
He's got all this stuff and lingonberries for like the very little money that was

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a lot of carpenters who were single they used to go there after work and eat

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
there and then they would go to the deer head pub right across the street and have some beers or whatever.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And that was like yeah yeah.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yeah

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
the Biggles going to Navy in the neighborhood that kind of you know what's funny is my brother was back to

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Norway and now they have a sense of Norway in Norway the Norway branch or the people

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
who left when they were young and then change that and they still like the membership part

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
of it so now they have members even though

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
it started originally for people who moved away from their country and

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
now they have it in one branch based in or a few branches based in Norway

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
all over the country in the United States as well. And then you lived in Brooklyn most

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
of your right. Yeah I mean I've gone back and visited in that way gone

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
back probably all had a couple of dozen times probably

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But yeah I've always. I like I like Brooklyn I like New York I like.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I like that you don't have to have a car to get around here it's nice convenient to take the

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
bus or the subway or your feet you can walk here

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
which I found at one time in Staten Island you can't like out of the but one place I was going to

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
set

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
jock something that Marshawn just marched on the Tibetan place. I got off the bus and

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
then I had a walk up to the top of the hill and I was the road I said oh my gosh you know

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the cars as it went by is that you really need a car here in Staten Island because it's

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.000
dangerous to get

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
up off the road you're at a luck. You know. So that's about it.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I left a photo if you wanted to because I had an extra one from the class we had last time of this the on the

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.000
floor thing and I

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
put some stuff some notes on the

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
back seat when I went.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Oh yeah I think I mentioned that my first time writing this my first time on

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
a horse and then I went like a few years later seven years later with my friend Nancy Moore

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
who lived at sixtieth Street with me.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We took the bus we felt very young adults you know took the bus I guess and he was always one of the first few

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
times going on our own I guess right now is be considered young

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
twelve to go up from Brooklyn just at night alone through it but at that time kind of a kind of normal.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And I said that they

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
read in the fifty's was known as the rich but then I think in the seventy's they

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
changed the perimeter because Before Sunset Park was just the actual park but

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
then it became a whole area and they broke a ridge up. Ben's made it look

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
further over towards their home.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So yeah that is my story.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah well tell us come.
