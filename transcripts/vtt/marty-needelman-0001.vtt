00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Actually I'm a newcomer I came in one thousand nine hundred eighty nine.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Right from law school I was

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a I was a VISTA volunteer lawyer and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I growing up in East New York. My first fifty years and same block

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the snow white flight we were forced to have the T.V.'s Canarsie

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
then I lived in Brooklyn my whole

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
life. I thought pointed with the boys University Law School at the Brooklyn

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
College and love for the sixty's and I thought of going to Boston.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I want to do public interest after the jobs available got a bit to join Vista volunteers and service to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
America as a lawyer and got

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to go I thought I was a go to Texas or Oklahoma and then come back to Boston which I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
love and the special program they had which is two years rather than one

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
year and we interviewed the people who have been the program the five boys we've

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
been the program before that and one guy when he wrote them I

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
went in to be my mentor and a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
great description of what he's doing that time so I joined I said

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
come to Waynesburg for two years I've been here ever since.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And they talked about growing up in Brooklyn.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Well it was in my my block Alabama Avenue in East New York

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
was like a little village. It was at that time was all working class and poor Jewish people.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The Jews originally came to lower east

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
side and then the next generation the business people moved in the middle class

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
more middle class mainstream Jews. Not good for the Jews.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
To Williamsburg Red Cross the bridge the poor

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Jews the working class and and and blank and Jews moved to New York in Brownsville.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
My family. And we live in same UK for eighteen

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
years and it was like a village.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Pete my smiter help my elementary school is a block from my house and then but it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
was people were

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
super friendly brain we should have been different ages and so we knew what they

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
were blocking people who you know everybody. And it was a very it was a like a village very so

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that when white flight happened when put we can start moving

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
in and all the whites we were the last white family left my family on our block.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It was very touching to me because I feel like I lost my home my my my my town.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so actually I realize that there are a lot of a lot that had an impact on my future life

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
in terms of defending people's right to stay and trying to preserve communities which is what we're

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
here and the fact is though if I moved away as broken in ways. Ever since I live in the same

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
block in Leesburg for the last forty five since one thousand and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
seventy two so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it's thirty three to forty three and forty three

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
years black and. It weaves back the whole time so it so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
a lot of the fighting a lot of my life and my work by those experiences as

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a young person and flood thinking is OK.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Was there anything.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That's just I was very supportive I guess it was a village

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
of most people in those days the world has changed a lot since then but most days

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
most of the people have been come from Europe prior generations. My parents were both born

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
United States but my grandparents were from here.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And so it was there's no conservative or form to this is all.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
See that observant doctor the like us.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We kept kosher the house that we change we also we kept

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
certain laws young Kipper Russia China.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Passover. But nothing else not not the Sabbath because that's why the work of US

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
postal workers that work in the news a clerk in even the main post office. And so he

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
had to work and if that was so he but we let them service and we would not that we

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
didn't follow the Jewish holidays like she will or the certain other hell they said was at

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the right. And many people I think most of the people like that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And we went to a school that have. With the public schools with the beautiful gift.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It was a very warm and support like I said like a village

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
people were very supportive and United a lot of weight on neighbors and very neighborly.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Here.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Well when I started out as I said I was a Vista and I was the reason I was pulling Saudi royal

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
family at the time. My present my predecessor My

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
mentor was working with parents so Cajun Thank you New

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
groups in the struggle for communicants role schools the ocean Brownfield

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
days

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and length you know ahead of that struggle over community controls much part as

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
part of much larger movement

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
afoot civil rights and. And a communicant show

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and very successful and was involved in organizing it with

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
what we did legal work that will support a lot of struggles.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And so

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
then I did I did that for about three years exclusively education related work

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
with those groups and then the world changed the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
City College dated those things with elections for Community School Boys things like

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that so kind of change and kind

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
of petered out in a successful way.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So then you know and the early seventies.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's switched and I think it was I work with community groups as the next phase of what they

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
were involved with was a struggle to get local workers into the

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
construction trades was a myth about the construction going

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
on for example in one thousand nine hundred eighty six were all hostile five hundred

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
units opened up

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the horizon. What it was called in those days Bell

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Telephone and a new main major building opened then test it

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
was constructed and opened up one new house me built in the in

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
the early seventy's and it will be really the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Democratic administrations that but I always wondered how they felt it was. There were

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
three developments.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Well public health three new developments. Fifteen hundred apartments constructed

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in that period and the other way is bring water from itself lean very much to the lot of

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
jobs construction jobs in those days. Construction jobs were united in their own

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
way and an Irish worker and was hit was father to son him down.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So in order to get the jobs we had. Demonstrate on the site stop construction very often

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and organize and mobilize.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
To get people on the construction site locally here and then they were

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
merged into the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
union and a very successful campaign it was worth it was very successful. There

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
were demonstrations of people got arrested and like that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And actually that was in conjunction with fight back which And then some things and had a

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
second group and

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
didn't

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
take the low. Good good I'm actually in the middle of an interview

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.000
here but what's

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
happening. Here I think I probably got it

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but what is the

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
say OK great. So I

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
can make it. A couple of people be there as well so.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It's me put there for thirty for of any help.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
If you get there a little early every great

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
to be there for OK Great great.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Thanks. So.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Sorry.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yes So this is I was at then.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Construction was none the wiser over that at that stage and then in one thousand nine hundred

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
seventy three.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I get

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
called if you know how I got a call back a call to attend association

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
group under visionary new who isn't right off the bat for

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
them and they were complaining people in the book is sick and I will try

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
to get them out of the buildings at that time his security had begun to

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
develop

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
really like in suffering's book which is actually very very

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
good between here. There is just one block past Broadway to the to

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the Navy Yard to the river and they were growing and they

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
were pushing out to see what had become like you

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
know families there. And so this is what it was like he went

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
fifteen Division you have your so I go to the meeting and I tell him I bring back my

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
background which is the organizing and legal stuff together we talk about it so how we're

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
going to fight but then I got pneumonia and I was out of the office read a

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
week and I came to the building with

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
him that in that week it all happened so I said to myself on that

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
like that happen in an economic it's

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
reverberated with my own history of epic displacement and I get over being displaced myself for

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.000
other

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
reasons and then the next two buildings similar things were

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
happening next to buildings. One is one upright equestrian away division and then went off for the mission

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and we. That was the beginning of

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
my business work and about six months after I began working with the first

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
one way to Vision interview.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
BARBOUR slip. Joint Committee organization called closer race the

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
south itself and United Front Office join to and participate with

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
me and with the organizer. It's actually me we were together in that building of the first building.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We worked on the first one we're on together with and she still has

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
a meeting with the credits in that building every month since one thousand nine hundred eighty four.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And what happened was it was the beginning of a lot of the stuff that

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
we we want to battle against a

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
specific history related landlord who actually was in this

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
building before we own this building right here. We had offices you came in one

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
hundred sixty acres and do a lot of private offices here and yet again it's

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
real estate office here and we organize me to organize attendance

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and fighting for court cases. So I'll use

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
materials about what our strategy is generally up its next nomic bores hold back the rent

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and bring a firm of case

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
than fight the nonpayment cases take advantage of the nonfunctional you the courts against limits

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
as opposed to what's going on now in the wise which is level taken care of forcing tennis to pay because.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And so and it was a

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
memorable moment

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
because it. I was on the third floor or us and second for the time here.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Third floor and he was on the fourth floor anybody be afeared I know very

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
well. Well from those who passed away and that's the five of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
the Holocaust itself.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And he he said this is one thousand nine hundred seventy

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
four a little off you know if you four thousand dollars drop the case.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
That four thousand dollars and eight hundred seventy four. So I said I can't take myself

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
out a lot for there's been no nothing for

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
you. His secretary saying to take it and I saw him

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to say

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
so the next day or a day later a guy walks into the building throws him off

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
of cocktail. And hit the building right now and we get to

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
that perhaps again an old one who remains in the building. So

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I called the F.B.I. told what happened if you guys came down

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
here. And he said What should I ask him

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
for nothing but one person stay in the

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
building and he brought to court cases we've got and we have

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
a court order.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We get the first appointed seven a number of that there's a provision of the law that's it that letter statute that

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.000
allows

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
for one third of the tenants in the building to see your point of an administrator. But

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
a polygamist

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
traitor to take people to run a

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
building and hardly look from from entering the building your position is only if

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
you present. I think what you're looking to do

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.000
over here

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
was really big thing and that's how we got

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to seventy

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
point and that was a decade with tending for

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the fire in the

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
facility verifying

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and we got some funding and the

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
stories communication lengths and money that a bill that a building survival fund and they let some

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
money to serve a minister said. So the other part of the war was the

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.000
statue had

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
been stuck in the fifty's was going Jesse gray to try to organize Harlem the hall and

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
ranch strike if that was resolved. They passed this that was they passed a

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
law allowing for tennis to bring these cases to prevent them from the ranch strikes.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But only one guy brawny

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
him and Laurie thought that these cases and it was really that love because you can find the ministries willing to do

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
it with no money involved and three percent of the ransom resolute.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
However what we did is we if the court to appoint. They had a community organization that looks or is

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
who is you know to be a lawyer or real

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000
estate broker or her or a notary or a.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It would be a lot of licensed broker or attorney or C.P.A..

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So none of them want to depict but the head

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
of the Commune organization most serious was a lawyer.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And so we had come to a point in the court declined to do so but it's at the pump we're going to want

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to have our guy appointed. So we had to step two was we had

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
a seventy mistruth a point to that our

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
guy didn't pay rent and we did a racetrack against him and he can bring a court case

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
against attendance for it but he had no money rapping about his pocket

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because they wanted the money in the pennant in the seven A So he back

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that he the you withdrew.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And we got our guy and that got to separated. Actually the reaping fifty of the building

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and restoring it in the tenants move back in.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Many of them had gotten them into new public housing it was being built at the same

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
time. So that children came in for many of them to this

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
day are people who were involved in the struggles early on and it became with them and

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
then what happened was if you get a trend seventy seven administrate

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
or less transfer the rent for The only be used for beer and make the

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
building not for taxes not for old

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
debts that for mortgages enough a problem. So the landlord wants the retain

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the building that a pay the fact that their own pockets are paid those old bills and those days no matter how

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
wealthy these limits

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
were and it's still somewhat true today that they had to pay

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
money have their own pockets and no say that there was so many building that has let it go let it go.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The city took its attacks took it from textbook pushing the city to want to the city they created

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
a program called attended

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
to release program prototype for the seven eighth's Relief Program where they leased building to

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
disseminate ministry. The city owns a bit more and they contain to seven

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
administrations in the city

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
develop a program that can bring these two loans and costs. Under a state statute cool

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
the private housing finance laws housing development funds

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
corporations Costco to expose the person to low income.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And the twenty fifth and then that they sold the apartments for Twitter still as the shares of the

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
apartments in this coffee for twenty or fifty dollars an apartment purchase price and

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
they were able to maintain very low rent to this day the rents are extra are maintained blowing

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and continued because it shows you how much money is involved in the profit in these

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
buildings without having to make a profit. You can keep rents low and maintain the building in reasonable condition.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And to this day they have now they are now and then the same thing happened next door.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
There was not been a pressure to bring their limit then up front then later than that from the building them but she did everything possible

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and we won that case all the same thing seven A.M. She was

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
up. And she was a wild person. My wife and my

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
family went on Yom Kippur. You go to your dream the Jewish that was

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
that period time you look to the water you can throw your sins

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
symbolically and the waters near where the concentration is security officials see

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.000
sorest going that

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
day me and my wife my two young

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
kids and she such screaming at

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
us and a crowd formed and were almost

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
violent and to call the police and simply because of it we had

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
a weapon that my friend surrounded us and watches that but that

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
was kind of people go but we took that bill that was one of what the mission

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
which Barbara still works with to this day. Likewise and that was that

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
began the trend and we've we've been led to believe that the years in those days was

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
slumlords or that his him trying to get to let you know example for other Hasidim.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
so. As I said people the slumlords were there

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
was bought by a building scandal it was out in the on the south side

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
where it was not the city. It was something

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
else the the mainstream Jewish community moved

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
out and replace but mostly Latinos coming

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
in but and this is a trend that was throughout the larger Very simply most

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
linear thing probably a lot of you know logic places that the little it

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
will brokers with to its lowest level it

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
would buy the building scared the landlords out here we're going to

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
coming in this were worth nothing by the building

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
she sell it to the next level or the collector and for him and recover

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
their their investment in two years. And sell to sell to sell the building and make a

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
fifty percent profit on top of that.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And recover their investment they get fifty separate until the next level and content that they will paint the hallways and say we're

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
going to be OK for me in the world here. The same exact thing and then finally they bring the building that was a very

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
common Bronx and burnings a

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
pattern here in Williamsburg resisted that and Billy's way of doing. So

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
that during the pretenders goes on seventy's and eighty's early

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
ninety's with both stories and of community organizations in other parts of win

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
for Green Point.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
There were over one hundred twenty buildings that were taken and made the co-ops as a result of the struggles.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Which compete in the course compete. In addition to that. So that's

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
that's that was a there was a deep sense of like of the work of the whole with those trucks

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and sink next neighbor

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
the same looks Alliance now. Something different in East

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Williamsburg and

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
South Korean point in North Korea point is not present building

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Corp in the north side those people's firehouse in the group called an egg was originally neighbors

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
against garbage no neighbors aligned with the group.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
But that coalition and that we've expanded to Bushwick over the years.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Bush recounting the pendants project.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So that that was the work that was the bulk of the work and then. Working with the parents O.C.A.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
sions and the cost to manage the buildings with the organizers there are

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
a lot of logistical legal issues and some of us just McCandless in terms of managing the

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
building and our goal has always been with his associations with these co-ops.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Transparency and collective decision making reports with

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
everything all the business is done it means monthly

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
meetings rents a collective range strike or co-op at the meetings with you to

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
get out at the ME support be given at the meetings checks aside that the meetings only approved by the group

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000
and that all the tenants or director over the head but that's a great majority.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
So that's that's that's

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
a very famous sometimes of you know nothing prepping those We're going Secondly But that's

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
the goal that's what we try to do so that's the so the bulk of the work was headed south Asia though and

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
then cost was the oldest and then some of them more recently have had problems

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
because of the corporate

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
value tremendously so what people pay to if you're out for a net worth three hundred thousand dollars and is

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
precious to you that the self the people on the side of it and some people some situations.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
A couple of peculiar building and try to make a profit on them that they can go back and all the

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
stuff that's the third thing we do is reps and community

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
coalitions. Going back to that separate time and

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
over all kinds of issues rezoning.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Environmental stuff we work with coalitions will be given that that's another major part of

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
that but the early Fair Housing is one of the major issues that affected the series continues to.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And where the first case of the

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
report was a lease break for how the waves break for Housing

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Committee challenged the cities the city's behavior in this

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
respect shocking behavior in this

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
area racist strict racial quotas in public housing

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
favoring basic Jewish community and

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
just innocently. So in the Jewish dream. He ran on the south side white

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
flight mention two recently the project to build public health right over here.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And and near by the way John Salinas houses and. Independents houses together

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
about his hundred apartments.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I mean we found out that there was one hundred fifty four when it opened up.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
We found that one hundred seventy six over here the situation. That they had been read stuff seventy five percent

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
white and maintain strictly strictly strictly from the fact that white is really Jewish.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Through a critic Amos a refuge for the Jews that will be out the neighborhood.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I suppose other areas where they moved to Los Angeles or the Isle of Long Island

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
here many of them stayed here because they are grateful. And it was segregated.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
In one thousand nine hundred six so

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
we. Let you know community based the Puerto Rican community which is

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
which is changed over the years and became organ Minnick you know. Have you looked at

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Mexicans and other. But the time was all Puerto

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Rican they came really after World War two It was some always there as it was a Hispanic

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
community but really the his security community really came in large numbers for different reasons if

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
the world were to have his security stating that the remnants of the Jewish community

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.000
in

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Europe. Some of the survivors came and then the lead put we can communicate

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
and post or drop saying they're working to get jobs here and

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
along the waterfront a lot of destructions. And they came in really at the road and

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
they kind of threw together. You have to report to the security community

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
has dramatic patterns

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
of childbirth because of religious rules and

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
otherwise they have the maximum number of children so every family has twelve or thirteen kids

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
or no kids of that have children at the

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
maximum it has a mega

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
growth that way he lets you know he's grown by immigration.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
So put a great group of truth in that then replaced

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
by major in front of the Minicons And then as if at the next.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
So but they have grown together to give them the put the Latino community is larger than it is

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
anything but. He said he votes as a block. I mean part of the issue with this

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
agree that eighty percent of the population is

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
loving teens because of the child so that their voting bloc is

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
tremendous missing small the bull population is if we smaller than the less you know population that

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
however has security both supply. It's led by the by the religious

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
leaders and the secular uses that dictate how the vote is going to block votes. I'll

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
give you five thousand votes or four thousand votes or give your opponent both of

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
them and I'm not a Democrat or Republican. I'm not conservative or liberal I can support a

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
gay black woman over a Jewish guy any

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
time. But here's what you

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
do and nobody wants to lose a thousand or ten thousand

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
votes in the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
city not in the state and as a result not federal.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Jimmy Carter if President were taken

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
forward to his sixteen I did that four to four pm that

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
if they hold off to the go shares with children then they finally go to

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
court and let's check in to political pressure so

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
racial

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
quotas study in sixty four but New York City.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
The government not some private landlord strict and the way this has always

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
been over ninety percent on white usually about fifty five percent black and forty percent

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Latino So yes we brought litigation in federal court in seventy six.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
We discovered in the new how this is because of the housing going up fifteen hundred years against Of the five percent

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
revenue racial quotas and seventy six and there was one project five hundred

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
apartments New York City public

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
health sixty percent Hispanic. So you percent

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Latino ten percent African-American every fourth exactly the same

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
for a B.C. you like

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
acidic lets you know.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Despite this thing. It was maintained that

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
way so that was the forgot the last of the stop them for the development of the court

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
order barring it and that was eight hundred seventy six in the seventh one thousand nine hundred

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
one to the world changes to go back to a value to the peer that new

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
housing is going

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
up on the waterfront.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Eleven city had newer been to New renewal development along the

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
waterfront eleven sites every single one was given notice that it developed for his sick only purpose

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
of housing for them

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
only with market rate housing so that lets you know can afford in

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
the Shivas or dormitories housing

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.000
for his

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
own and things like

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
that to grow if a challenge that we also reviewed the price situation the product

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
court ordered and lo and behold despite a federal court

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
order the city maintained

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
that members of all the fifty three thousand between one thousand nine hundred sixty one thousand and one thousand one

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
thousand and ninety one

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
means they violated a federal order to maintain strict racial

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
and discriminatory as over the years after that too and we were going to Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
A deliberate intent case through two thousand

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
and five until the Lisa See's part of it was that these projects as

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
of two thousand left the project remain all the public health things here in Maine every single large

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
apartment occupied by whites in his system

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
and collectively only slightly less than five percent their parts

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
are occupied by whites. There's been some change but when it's been over ninety

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
percent triple protect

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
them so bizarre and shocking. What happens

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
is a sick feeling will

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
then the old is legal that but then when it was over

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.000
that remained

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
there really

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
they they have their children

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
stay at least. Like your thing moving and the children generations

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
it is

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
some hocus pocus bills

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
and so that contains minutes we have to do a lot of

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
litigation about that and there are other things like the

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
great waterfront in two thousand and five when they go should represent to the coalition that negotiate

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
a settlement of the city no no no no litigation but the contagion of the groups

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
and demonstrations and the Goetia in the city to

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
maximize another for the healthy living. We now involved in mega

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
litigation involving the Broadway Triangle area which is a large urban area at the intersection of that's

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
the Williamsburg. Because once again the Bloomberg

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
administration. Gave over sixty percent of the city and

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
territory to a civic coalition with some people up it was very politically

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
very powerful political figures. Had they had to keep happy Democratic

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Party

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
and and I don't like the way that was the only company that has secured.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Low rise that will you feel it is a

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
savage

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and just a cover up was a living. The result. Only

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
the bullies break sites we use birth for means the five

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
percent black despite a lot of blacks living in public health.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
A lot of Public Health says I see no African-Americans living up to that I thought a public

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
outing Waynesburg three point let the five percent

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
black that start right across the

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
border over the Broadway tribal or renewal

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
area is was over seventy five percent really close to ninety percent that America was

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
separated recently seventy five

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
percent. The only reason on the Waynesburg side.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
That's a good excuse for them for the real reason was that your fifty percent preference for affordable housing

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
built in these areas to residents of the local

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
area in this case board

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
was saving these so that you know you've been including me or three also look at

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
that site. It was a clue that the. The problem that we

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
got so all this craziness going on in the nation the.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
One time we actually came together with his security. Because the city had plans.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
To kind of deal with the when they close

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
the garbage sites to the dump and that with a double to go up to instead

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
of this that night when they if they built a Verizon bridge

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
that they would pay for like look at a landfill in Staten Island or all the garbage near things with them.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So they had to find out what do we do with the government now. So the plan was to have a

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
single in garbage incinerator in each

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
barrel and they've missed at least part of course in progress that the Brooklyn It's

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
an array of the fifty seven story Center eight are right at the Navy

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Yard right next to public housing. You know so so they sit here

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
and let you know he can get

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
it and we watched over the purpose of that Weaver bridge to City Hall and all kinds of stuff but it

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
was great thinking together and saying that to

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
do stuff like that so

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
that those companies and I did a lot of press stuff also had pension

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
work with give took its I was they were like was the borders of the way because we don't just do

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
the litigation. We have well we're very close

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
to what you said injuries.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Yes

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Yes well unfortunately like I said we're trying to be very active case minute for the what

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
you

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
can tease to be issues like that but

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
rezoning displacement pressures created by that we

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
see the slumlords now it's gentrification and use displaced pressures.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
So the resulting allowing for the creation

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
of mark a great helping. If you have a significant twenty thirty

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
percent of what will

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
help it a definition of what was not to affordable to our communities but

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
be the construction of. Market rate

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
housing. Does not meet that demand increase

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
it becomes a magnet and huge displacement pressure. So it's a war. So it's just like with

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
the flood was an elf a war against limits. If they can get five thousand dollars for a two

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
bedroom I think it twenty five

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
dollars for a two bedroom apartment and people paying a legal rights they left

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
with a simple and struggling to pay seven hundred forty three dollars bill kill to get

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
it and that's what's happening.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And so we've had

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
and I love his criminality. I'll show you a

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
new op ed piece we did for the you Daily News recently last month.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That said that the little bit of the myth about the criminal

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
behavior that is being treated as housing cases that actually it's totally criminal behavior you

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
know plenty of people burning buildings down all that kind of stuff.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So it's a worry when we continue to do that I'm as a metaphorical reps of the organ working

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
with the organizers continuing to the tenants and then to

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
the also the co-ops remain a major issue often sustain them to

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
live off the edges of a lot of the same stuff.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
What can you think that it's.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Well I think like I said my my my

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
my my childhood having lost my community and that want to

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.000
see

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
have the successes the it's

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
very

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
empowering like realize that I've been blessed because I've had situations where really it's

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
that

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
individual low income people have no power. So when people who are low

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
income coming together and having power and winning the battles and

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
in the affirmative battles and not just use that line the courts to

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
dominate the power people to to force labor and the rest of the world

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
to realize that they have to deal with them.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Fortunately it continues with the new

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
mare. We are unfortunately talking to.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
But a lot of what's happened. Continues to be the same stuff at the street level not

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
an overt not functionality you control at the street level a lot of people who work in the city

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
are carry overs for holding their traditions and old

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
visions the big vision was benign neglect.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Let's put that don't help poor people and move out of the neighborhoods and let's get rich people in and pay our

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
taxes if this is a condominium vibrant your city built the

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
parks enough of the people that get to the people vote.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And that's what's next. He's to be very much a case of

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
spite claims otherwise. And also you've been a lot

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
of attention to the Blodgett reaching out to the ones

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
that you're ready to secure community and

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
again try to work within trying to get that support in order to do it in the New York Times about that.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
But the whole circumcision thing but they say it was a much larger issue in terms of

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
him try to

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
accommodate him and make friends with his fortune I believe

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
is part of what's going on here as well we also are

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
involved with the city the Bloomberg administration.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Unfortunately continues today the city is abandoned take you said

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
to me

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
but I'm going

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
to live a life in the not renewing leases and allow them to be forced out

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.000
which is the

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
infrastructure where you know.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
And part of it is was the old benign neglect situation but now

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
the budget is strange and I don't know because it's shocking

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
the consistent behavior but to the pocket about

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
the people to look

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:55.000
into

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
for people who

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
have. Raise

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
the

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
bar that has

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
seven Great thank you nurturing community centers

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
it's part of the community.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Staines provides all that they both want people to work.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
And

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
able to do you think you have a loving environment there truly neighborhood based environment.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Also I believe somebody has to be privy to

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
the city leadership who are connected to the park.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
So I don't feel like I can think it was a wise ministration has not

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
moved to protect this place we're fighting that

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
when we always win but the question is how much

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
of

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.000
anything else you want

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
to not really I

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
mean also the block where I live. I've lived there for forty four was

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
over forty for forty two three years. That's become I know a new village and brain knows each other

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
and despite the pressures elsewhere. Most of the buildings on my

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
block and some of the surrounding area

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
are owned by

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
non-profits or teach the F.C.S.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
and a lot of people who remain are the children of the average And so it's again it's

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
like sort of like the village kind of environment and supportive and nurturing friendly.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
But a very good part of my life as

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
well thank you so much for taking time out of your day because

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I got off my

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
pleasure.
