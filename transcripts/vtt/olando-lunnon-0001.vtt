OK

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Sue. Was describing that with a pull to do above.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
In front of the building. You know they have to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
walk through

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
about four feet and then there was a little drive through

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
through this war in the seventy's and the so this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
isn't always right and we're very good. So we do

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
see the bases of the first one The first

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is the second the thirty. This

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
tube is

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
on pretty much all created from nothing. Just have all the media will do this

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for them over who couldn't walk off water for the morning to you know bore.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Jack to the table door from

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Iran. No later than Saddam

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
or you want to hear it is so that it involves inside me and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I do feel pretty much

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
invisible and soon.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Well inside the saloon for

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
his honor and so on

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but and then will go on in that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
area for a five hour with said hello to the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the building. There's a stick up for

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
some crises for those

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of us in the.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Oh it's understood has changed so much in time.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
From the knowledge over there within

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the hour which is not on and didn't is no longer

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
there and it's simply.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
A pickoff flinches which is. It was of old age

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and or

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
progress of the bill for.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Peace.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And didn't you know it evolves and changes.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Even though. We're Christians I ventured

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
know. And there was sort of riches

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
there was not credible data that we're used

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to you know it all

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
happened I doubt saw the news of the people who. This is a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
long story. So

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
listen in to that so

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
along. The whole

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
year for a very long. So.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The news in the restaurant is

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the same Julien's does not.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Even today you will see the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
song on.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
One store on the.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Yeah

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and also do Asians do it for

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the creators in the restaurant and in the store.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Group of rubber. Well the out of the store

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
here comes and this is

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
why there is none of them on the crew.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Well series from the store less

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
the SO resonance and.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Yes.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that's

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
why. It was a

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
very well. I

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
guess she.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Can do it for the season.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
See but.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.000
To

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
see you know for a long time.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Or this is how much is is the

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
same which has changed so it's.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Oh

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to be so all

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
the things that brightest

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
so grown up I was actually in

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
school. So there is just

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
something jumping the graduate into a job.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So the only one to good people in the community and

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the help

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of my resourceful.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Wow and positive work.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I don't know if he still have

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
so. She's going to quickly go to

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
college activities and.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Do. You know.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
First you know you have to be all those who you.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Margaret are all rich and. Now

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
struggling to do the best in their group.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So after losing the this

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is due

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to the second. School

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
so he goes on.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Key which is probably the least expensive. We're going to have this.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Paid to do it so I had out of a job doing whatever bit and you

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
know during college I worked in well you know

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a secure job just so he got an hour in the college and

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
college loans and pay off. So I'm doing

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that. Do the work process called America.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
so good so do that we're going to from

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.000
your physical

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to say which of the following high school in

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
downtown Brooklyn his. Issues and the world

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
winds he noted all in the school did Y.M.C.A. he's in

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
town to work which is a new diseases

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and a visual person with the horses and cars love. She's just and

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
just getting too hard to judge. The lack of you

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
want to do it over a

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
position. How's I work. And so I

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
did that and then the Sun King said we want the summer camp

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
over with. And the cost of doing

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
here comes on her which is

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
worse than this year for

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
her to show them.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This alliance. With the hundred something kids today

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
have we.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And yeah we saw it at the same gym program which is the

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
first and so I've really well in front of the sun care programs those

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
insurance committee. We took them on and at school program.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Is to run and. Since

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
all this is because I did what I had to do to

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
get the program so I think it was good for me because you know I'm

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
not the sort of I went to school to this

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
neighborhood. On this

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
in the fall

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
does the lack of preparation some fool.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Was that she says the situation in the community

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and with the system as

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a whole New York wrote a bunch who did

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it coarsens and what happened in the end when it rolled out and how

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.000
all students

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
across the city did so that things. You know I

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
was proud of that so I can see the students will

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
come on and they're going to this is who

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and this is a very good connections with this

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
school. Other

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
people and.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
The Lebanese among others I have nothing

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to do with

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
any of the

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
school but I'll

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
go is the desire to learn so

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I can do a service and do

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
good work at GNC which is

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the college cruise or

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Greensboro area and then

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
have the University

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
of St Johns in other schools come

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
here to tell the difference and shooting or cause.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Cause not question. But it

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
will come to the wrong house to

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
a of those different schools in

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
some cases to the school didn't

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
elect for the school and we're here in D.C. or our

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
show is needed and this is all

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that involved so. My mom goes to slide among those of

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the See you need some of the your kids want something that you don't

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
know exists.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
If you don't know

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
exactly what you do a fire is out

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
there so I feel confident and how

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I can do that I can tell them about school do connect to the need

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
to know that for a long

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and my school it with funding on bad

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
schools. So why would I want to go but a

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
college husband

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in school activities like fancy

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
pants she sort of lost on all of us

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
different out reasons we would never come to mind

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
you do not dear.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So you know that I know it exists I can

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
try when I do but introduce other people

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
those cities into my own I'm not black but

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
is this five years ago was a reason

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
fire.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
All of these of our older

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
students using some of his stuff.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
He was to the consist of.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And it always surprises. People there were only a matter

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of people so surprised the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
world

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
grew because of his

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
disability status serving the people who want

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to do. Certainly the last one year.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Oh well their affair and track this is of some you

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
know he was in love and truth who came to a season

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and season three years

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
ago and of interest this young man with the

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.000
version

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that he said I'm going to I'm going to post

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and I heard one of these

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
from school shoddy work since it was a devil

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
now and he

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
just took a long out really good idea but he

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
did

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
see the last.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Because it is out of the this is a busy selling job

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and this is just a confidence but he had a four time job with

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
an

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
track person is you know is also out there.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Even with this is the he's self-sufficient. You know we

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
have the students who are in the house was reading

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
one of my other

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
students one of the good city. This is

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
this he was another who had

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
problems with his

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
academics he was a father because you know we are all you will go all

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.000
out

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
to see series of lessons so heinous act

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
children were not

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
however good the words of the you or did

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
he do the go. He

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
was going off to

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
school we took on that and we're going to something useful and with us and then

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
we're this is a new program. He graduated from school because of then and

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
now being active in the challenge.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
He graduated from college and he's using you know these and

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
to and to. Back to work there were enough programs throughout the school

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
program dating back to work with us and some

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
new Another successful one last year was

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
who salute programs and we had this to go through this is

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
a college she

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
says she's already finished House side should she do

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
the test and she still want to.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Do usually the small can afford to pay her what she's worth

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
but still the airport is awesome

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
it's just Friday and we had a we had a

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
teacher then

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
said to come on home then need for on some more

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
shows but issues with the weren't too good for this just a lot

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
of work that I should get something out of fear.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
So she's a deuced. Has a dental

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
problem and said where you're going to show

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
them the parents brought on this show.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Well you know that she

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
was also on our program every summer for her son Prince

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
of them you know to do this we created quite

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
a few years to do that

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
sort of all and then we're sort of using

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
some. You know for the parents of the principal there and you know

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
it was right and we have had sort of someone who says.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I have a

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
student and he was he too soon

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
to get her very bored

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
all last. Time issue. Tiny

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
issues a rite of passage session for you and the song

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
what is the point of this issue do you want.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Hostile and non-hostile you need to lead and do you

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
not in the basic you cannot be. You want

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
to other people to get the. Go on going

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
somewhere and yes two sisters a little brother and the

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
mother also building that he can't yet

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and he was yet.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Some red shoes on her shoes and

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
with her shoe This is

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
of

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
course you can do. OK Number

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
one

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
she number.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
So.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Someone now uses it how did she love all of

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
my good today to a mother. We

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
stopped her school and college.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Called days and days and all the time I

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
didn't have a tie

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and you know

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Todd.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
That's

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
right.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
She

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000
left. Work.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
When I first heard of do it with.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
It was something to

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
do

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I was just trying to be. Gone through

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
and started just something that's gone through that I started

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
to realize that you know a lot of the Southern issues that I

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
guess I'm just a little like me then my good sir and then they couldn't

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
do the things that really. So

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the whole war and to the west of the world to

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
disagree even being here this is either. We assume that you

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
should have read books there who

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
have you know there's a bunch of should know better both from

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Conoco. And even though it does some of the video. But this

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
so many are on

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
insulin resistance on the

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
bread was the household your phone

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
book and the whole import income how did you find in Europe.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And they don't do that no does not undermine the order.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
So the notion that a variable and something is doesn't exist in your life or your salon.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
How do you know you show

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
that and then when you do pick it up to do its heart is

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
not easy and then it puts a

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
book missile attack or video in there it is done

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
here good desirable because both of us in this world.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Somebody's already written down or there's nothing new under the

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
sun. You might want to get a change in to us and was

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
already here is if you

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
want but if you don't know they did

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
exist or you can pull out the images of Diana and

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
here to say there's a group is a very wealthy nation but

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
outside forces had

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
to come inside and didn't find the energy so

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
the taking out. In the shoes. You know you know the

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Home Soon afterwards they can get it for losers

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
because they don't have the skills that. Or the knowledge of

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
the loss in the shoes of she.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
I

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
also like to go to prison compared

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
with. Greed and then ensure the

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
sin. Population. How do you make sure that

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
you have children by ninety percent. Well

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
that is going to leave nothing else for the new you will go here

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
in Buffalo.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
So you know it is a time when I love you love the

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
city that it was more like the big of these are things and they

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
go for the they go bad about each

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
other because knows how to be a young child. The good bad

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
shot done so you know of the school that will know your

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Indian so I can't read or I'm not good it

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
is you know so and realize that out of it is

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
to be aware that it is not

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
embarrassing is not calling you out and once you start to do

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
something to see below and who need to know that you

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
can invest in that how do you do to me my first to

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
do was a fool to myself that I'm this is good

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
enough the house from the first

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
duty is just with just

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
going to have to do it in the go

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
under I will miss

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
it and I'm going to

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
say.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Yeah.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Yeah.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Or one big problem.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
That I had my time today don't have today.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And my day.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
There are sixty seven houses to get in town hall and

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
peek and you know the thing of

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
homosexuality that already. However to date

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
is down to its present and

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
it is promoted that now I'm OK but this isn't long.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Where is not. This is not how many see everything

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
on

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
most men. What's going on on her family or

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
a huge daisy here of all of them and.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
The girl with a high finger on the lever

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
on the cell research is different and we have younger than

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
we used to

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
be is on the order of the have two five or no shows you know if

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000
you're dating rows of people who have a year old without shoes and mini session.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So you know their pants are younger and the younger you have to

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
do things a lot quicker. So you have a solid seventy eighty

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
ninety days of living. You have

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
then and then your child is gone and we do not know

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
them and they have their own and then they are put into a

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
system where this she should

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
assume these people have homes and these people and I hate these people are not

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
her principles and you know that so it's

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
still something to do that is the root of the not

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and the school system had

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
become not just a nice big world

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
have to design a dangerous element with

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
the school that teaches and I do respect

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
my teachers and today I have to say that this is

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
the teachers of excellence.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Hum. So to just speak like students and I don't want to reach them but this

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
year the

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
respect or. You know you shouldn't always something to aspire to you know.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
You walk in the streets and I was up with a
