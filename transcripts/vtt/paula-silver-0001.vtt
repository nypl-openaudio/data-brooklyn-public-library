00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is our heart and here our streets are Tory.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Project Park Library in February two thousand and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
three and I'm

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
hearing where you are or have was born in Berkeley.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you work in Bedford Stuyvesant in nineteen

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
thirty nine.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.000
No

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
no I was there until I was swimming lessons. Then my family

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
moved to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Queens. So I feel my parents had a candy store on the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
corner of Stuyvesant in green and then it was a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
very hard life going to my father kept the store open fiction a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
half day and he opened it at seven in the morning and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
close to that eleven and he take a nap in

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the afternoon. So when they were able

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to say they shoulda it and move

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to clean and.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You know send the candy

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
store was my parent's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
way. Of. In a sense getting them self

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
out of the depression during the depression my father.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Had been snatched he was his trade he was a had happened trend

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
maker and he had a care and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I hatched a war on change Mark seven you and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that business sale and. It was very hard for him to find

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
work after that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as I don't know how many years. He was found and who or what had

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
just occasional work but my parents had

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to go and live with his mother who had

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
a brownstone on Vernon they have a new.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What you have yes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I was born on.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Six months and after my

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
parents bought the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
store when they bought the store my parents my mother was pregnant with me.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I have a brother who was born in that same location

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in nineteen forty five and I have an older

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
sister and to tell you the truth I don't know where my

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
parents lived when she was born but she's nine years old at night.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I knew her very young.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Oh now I remember many memories who have a store. I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
mean. Why didn't we had

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
all fashioned penny candies where with

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
us why entered Kalash showcase.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And you know kids would look in one of those along

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
of and we also have a very small

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
fountain was cerise two walls and my

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
father made malted she made the best small thirds when he

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
made Sundays.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I actually of the chic read of the exceptional malted but I will tell

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
what are you made a cream.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Of

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
course and we have I think three or four.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Besides For found which had a marble.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I don't know what you call him

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
character. We also had three or

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
four square tables

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
with

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
wire chairs all fashion. Her chair she

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
was wooden feet

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and. We also have

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I counter that where she grew

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Red Shea and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
cigars were sold. And

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
we had magazines and the comic

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
books

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
were in a commoner. And I used to

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
love to sit there and read the comic books on the days they came in

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I'd read a hundred.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I used to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
during I mean I remember the store during the Second World War

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
became irradiate an eerie drill

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
saying everything would go

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
door and Air Raid Wardens was come around they were the only people

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
who had a little flashlight going

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
on the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
floor

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and in a storage shed we

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
sold cigarettes and cigars and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
tobacco pipe

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
tobacco and I too remember shelling

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
single cigarettes which will call whoosh.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And at that time they were penny

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
apiece. You can say wow riled.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's my sister's job she was. I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
said nine years older than I was.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Was to make

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
up the newspapers especially putting together

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the section of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the Sunday I didn't have a job I guess to use

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to do it. But that was her responsibility to make up

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
the Sunday papers and put all the sections together.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I we had some really wooden phone booth.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Whoa whoa.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And. For those phone booths

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
we get holes for people in the neighborhood.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And one of us would go out and ring their bell and tell them they had

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
a phone call.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Would go to work

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
remember we had a stand with newspapers outside

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the door not unusual in those days we had also.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Why

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
one of use

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
nettle ice chests. Where

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
there were things like ice cream pie

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
can get clique up. You've heard of those now

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
or roles.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Or maybe the men were worlds winners. There may be three. Father kept them at

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the the soda

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
fountain.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But again how it was lively It was a neighborhood

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
play for a never but I knew what it was.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Not like. People whose parents went to work someplace

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
away and. The

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
neighborhood

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
was majority African-American. And.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
see. You know white

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
kids were you think your way Shaw

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
capital. And the Catholic

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
being Irish or Italian background.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now when I was in the third grade. I remember the

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
first. Puerto Rican cheered to come into

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
my class and that was

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
probably. Nine hundred forty eight or forty nine mine

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and I remember this. So

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
clearly his name was Jose.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And but I saw he spelt it with a J.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And that was inconceivable to me

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
because it was an H.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
sound. And he was a funny kid a

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
mish G.U.V.'s kid. I was a goody goody.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Set. I was quite a dog

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
walker and

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
walking for my house we live behind the

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
store. That's another important thing. So my parents were never

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
away for a bit really

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
walking to school.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I wish. Jeff the door to where I had to walk

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.000
one

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
block. And the other

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
block I

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
think I'm not sure what it was to get to my school P.S.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
fifty

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
seven.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And I

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
remember I would just always thought of the old be

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
like how you call it the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
hatches or for the farewell great tonight run up and down.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I'd be walking up appliance or growing in the.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
In the cracks in the

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
sidewalk and I was invariably late for school

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
so

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I left in plenty of time my

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
mother saw

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
What else can I tell you remembering that there was a butcher

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
across the

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
street in Nice. Blocks And still to this

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.000
day

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the stores were on the corners. And the butcher curse

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
street was Polish and you

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
know I remembers name Polish can have

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
one and I don't give a given was

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
there and my mother was

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
from Bialystok but that was from

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
a Jewish section of Poland and say she grow up speaking

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Yiddish she learned a little bit of

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
polish in.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
When she went to

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
school and she was so proud of herself when she could

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
remember especially the Polish were to tell her this but you.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And on the other end of our street. He was a

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
grocer and they

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
were Jewish it was the

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Lieberman and you know they

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
were good

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
friends with us and we were friends with

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the people who lived in the building

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
more. Especially my

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
sister. I mean we didn't have very much

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
room behind the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
store. There was kind

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of two rooms a kitchen in the bathroom and so

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
as my sister got older. Remember

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
we were live there or Intel she

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
was perhaps in her junior

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
year college or pro con college.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
That

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
she we rented a

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
room for her upstate. Shares in the apartment of one of

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
our

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
neighbors because it just wasn't enough room.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
When she was older and she just quiet to study and

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that's

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
stuff.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I'll tell you also

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
about the candy store and moving to Queens.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
My mother a wish for the school. Why even an

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
accomplishment that they were able to do that because

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
they had those

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
years of

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
just being depended on my

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
grandmother who you know I don't know where she

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
had any money from she when she came to this country she was a

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
widow and she married a man with six

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
children. All right well it wasn't so weird then.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and so she had the house she inherited the house when

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
he died. That's how she got

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
a brown stuff

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
from her husband Mr Black who was always called

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Mr Glass.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
He was never called anything else.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And my father was close with children of

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
his

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
sadness and one of

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
them worked for us in the store he would do his out there

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
job in the morning which is tell the truth I don't know what it was and

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
then he come in the

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
afternoon and work in the candy store. Till dinner

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
time while my father

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
no less I said my father open and close

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.000
the

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
store.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What else can we tell you about this. My mother

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
said You should we make such

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
a killing after the war when you've

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
got marble girl three years he had been you know Bob

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
although I don't know why.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
But I'm They did get this. I

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
guess bazooka or something like

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that and you're SOL white black hot cake and

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that was exciting to her.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
didn't have a car during the war when my parents had a core when they

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
were young married but also when the

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
beginning gas gas gas was ration and oh who had ration books.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Of

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
course. And I had a whole

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
bank account when you bring in Nic also quarters and put it in your

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
bank account every week.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
use to collect

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the fat from cooking. And take

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it I don't know where we took that puppy to the butcher and they

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
would use it I guess in some kind of whale a few

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
all

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
our immigration books. Well know.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You can see from the pictures that of course my brother had

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
a high carriage and I remember

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
going to there was the first war

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Bones' supermarket was on decal Bhavin you use a

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.000
good

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
walk from us near the Bushwick why

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
bery you know that it's not cold.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Question why there is a time Bush or Andy

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Kalb maybe called it a caravan.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
We use to walk there and shoot buy groceries and we put them in the

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000
carriage with my brother and take them back.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Once

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
in I remember Brown growing up member.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
There With You should

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
real Brooklyn gay parades and the

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Brooklyn Day parade

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
with the wish to call it anniversary day because it was the

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
anniversary of the public

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
school. My now public school

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I guess

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
the Christian

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
school. That union founding.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And it was mostly kids and

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
baby carriages that would get courageous with

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
flowers that we made from folded

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
tissue and never was a day we had off from school and they

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
had they still as a Brooklyn Queens

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Day and it all it was a Brooklyn Sunday School

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
new minyan that's what it was call.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And I

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
remember our feet

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
both VE Day and V.J.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Day.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And now I don't just standing. If the war was over how come it will hold

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
for

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
again

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
and till it was

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
explained to me and I remember people are dancing young star Iverson have a

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
new Everybody been loud and

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
throwing. You know turn our paper is considered

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
a if it's a kind of thing you know

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
remember the day Franken knows who more than

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I would have my

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
grandmothers and I turn the radio. Oh

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I used to listen just soaks up my lunch hour from

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
school. I used to listen to and they were fifteen minute show

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
barbers I get all Friday and and G.N.A.T.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
those are the true I used to listen to and I was

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
at my grandmother's house that day and I went to put on the

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
radio and all I could get was

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
classical

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
music and I didn't understand

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
it and then it was explained should

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
be and and I remember I don't know what day of the week now.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Was that all the programs were changed in

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
respect

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
for President Roosevelt

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
there.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And. Let me see something

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.000
else

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
about that I remember the cover of The Daily

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
News magazine section was an

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
uncompleted portrait of him. That was

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
being painted at the time that he died.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And I was on the cover that

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I also remember the

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
election for Truman and doing.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And a question our family.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Everybody loved Roosevelt. But my father always said he

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
loved Roosevelt and he voted for him but he was a

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Republican and of course effort all the other. Adults.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
MY DAD Yes my sister my mother. They voted Democratic and my

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
father voted

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
do

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and you know it needs

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
like no real friction but some in the

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
family and then when doing what do we did not when after

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
the newspapers predicted he would win it was

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
an event.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Where

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
else to our member I remember so many saying

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I know Queen should you make a high school.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I in fact

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I we moved after I finished the

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
fifth grade.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
P.S. fifty seven.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
So I had sixth grade and then junior high

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
school including.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Right well I went to Jamaica High

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
School. And then I went to Queens College was a chemistry

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
major and I couldn't imagine what I would do was tamest but I

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
did I never really thought about having a career.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I was just good at school and I continued to do what I was good

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
at that's what. And so I went to graduate school

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I think well like I can't imagine what I could possibly do chemistry.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So I decided I don't fly for

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
biochemistry in graduate school.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And I actually went to Harvard.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And I ended up in microbiology.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And I like I mean. But I was

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
never meant to be rushed or I didn't have enough confidence that

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I was

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
doing so I was really mostly a

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
teacher.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
When we came we live in

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Manhattan. My husband.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
When our daughter

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
was born and for your better.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
One bedroom apartment get a bigger place we looked all around.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
We never knew he grew up in the Bronx.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
But we never knew about Portugal. It was not

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
an area we ever

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
knew you know we

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
had family or I did who

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
live on cram

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
high tide and showed I

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
had cousins on my father's side who lived on

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Carroll story but it was Carol. All the way damn probably

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
near downstate something I didn't know this neighborhood

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
as. Well.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Although my

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
grandmother lived on Vernon venue and

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
my husband who is from the Bronx. His

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
grandmother no longer alive for nine matches had

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
been lived on Hart

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
street which was

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000
also in Bedford Stuyvesant.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
And not far from over

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
there. So I guess that's where people know

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
after the lower side.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
What.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Yes

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Yes We bought a house on president.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
No

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
now

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
we bought that house and signed the contract in nineteen sixty eight.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
It took us till nine hundred seventy to get into what we were buying

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
from crazy

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
lady.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
But there were a lot of crazy ladies around here in those times who told

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
us the building was decontrol them we came to took

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
the contract

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
signing and she had no decontrol papers

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
sold then it turned out she had the right to get get a

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
decontrol but she hadn't done it.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
OK because she had done the conversion from one family into apartments.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So we had to wait till she got the control papers in order to close.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Seven

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
years

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
and then my husband I

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
separated. And I'm he was some presence on the

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
park blocked. I moved to

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
cancel between seventh and eighth. And I live about

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
three years and then for my half of the present and I bought

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
a house on Fourth Street between Fifth and Sixth which I've been in

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
from thirty

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
years and my

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
daughter grew up in this neighborhood she went to public school.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
She went to three twenty she went to high as eighty eight

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
which want to know if I knew better.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I probably was a centrist. School

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
years and then she went to middle

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
and. You know she's grown to

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
be an age a cave

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
person and I can't possibly I'm just name why

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
she didn't want to

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
live she lives in central Connecticut.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
She wanted she didn't want to live

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
in the city she had an experience.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
When she was in college but she lived

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
in and she and she came

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
back here and she had summer

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
job working

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
for

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
department something or social work social

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
welfare and aid so

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
prices and she was like in

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
the put us are and people were

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
hassling young

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
kids so. She said

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
how could you live

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:17.000
here.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Well I can't tell you about all of what I like about Brooklyn stitch defer

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
shipping. I think I

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
like that the best. I like the high density of people. I

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
like the fact that it had an ambulatory

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
life when I was first with was

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
done Long Island for a year and a

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
half and you had to get in the car to get

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
a bottle of milk or to mail a

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
letter and here. What I

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
said if I'm wrong on Seventh

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Avenue the ocean no way I won't.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
No You know when in the early years

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
here. You know we were connected in many

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.000
ways

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
is a babysitting

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
co-op individual food co-op not

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
the big one the time you're in huge tree. We go to the Brooklyn

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Terminal Market to get fruits and vegetables and Jerry Parr to bring them

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
back and divide them up and everybody took a share. But there

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
was many community organizations and that's how we measure for

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
them and and the babysitting

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
pool was great.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
You got when you joined thirty tickets each ticket was a half hour.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
So if someone sat for you you gave them two tickets an

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
hour and if you sat for memes you'd get them

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
back and you know when you call

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
the people you like to a kid your age if your kid and

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
it was a great

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
thing was very very nice. Oh and the most

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
important thing. It was a

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
time of consciousness raising groups. You know

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
what they all are. And

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
so. Most

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
of the people I knew here or consciousness raising

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
groups they started at different times with

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
different scientists

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
and we had one that

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
was kind of diverse because somehow.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
We hope in with now and they sent us people

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
from out of the neighborhood who were.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
You know slightly different

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
backgrounds. I mean we had an ex not him or her.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And we had African-American young women

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
who had a very different background from

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
all you

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
know it was great it changed all

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
of our

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
lives.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And my dearest

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
friends come from that time I live.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
No question

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
that because the world watched us

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
by a lot of this and that

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
but we really became in to really knew each

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
other that.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
It was a basis for great friendships

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
that have lasted that

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
C.R. and seventy one seventy

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
two

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
and I was going to buy plants from the book and

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
turn on the market with two people I knew from the babysitting pool and they

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
told me they got it they were going to this meeting.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
This is why don't you come. I didn't know what it was one one.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
None of us you know we just played a year.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
people went through a lot of changes and changes in

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
their expectations of still

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
lives.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I think it

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
was very much for the better.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Well

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
we're just OK.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
I like like

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
say that from the time I was a trial.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
The Brooklyn

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
public library has a very important to me.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.000
As I

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
said my fish delish nine years

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
old and she took me

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
to Cal bridge to get my first

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
library card I should have said.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And I just

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
remember how because I knew

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
how to write my name.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
But you couldn't write it in pencil you had to write

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
it in pain that you dipped in a bottle of

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
ink and I was terrified I was going to blot out or

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
make a big mess. And I just love wide

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
prairie and you know I have from a lot of memories.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
All of the same

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
building and mostly for myself as a little

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
child Chandra was where I went with my sister who was by then

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
in college or something but my library was the one

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
on Dekalb brochure that was renovated probably ten years

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
ago although the May Come. Was closer to us

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
we never went

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
there I don't

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
know

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
I used to go to the also Brooklyn Children's Museum wonder in the old hang

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
out it was a little walled town kind

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
of I wouldn't exactly call it the mansion.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I used to go there and my daughter was to Brooklyn. They're

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
called Children's you see. Current

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
incarnation. So.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
If you get me go out if. I

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
don't think.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I really wanted to do

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
it I mean I'm interested in neighborhood

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
history

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
and I'm trying to get

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
together this summer when

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I'm when things are quiet. I'm going to go on Ancestry

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
dot and find out. I

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
know how my mother

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
came to this country to find my father came and.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Her year and a half year

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
all and can't

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
find my fish just thought she had the bug she came out but.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
We both share the bills leading up to Boulder

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
and they don't

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
have a record of them.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
So I'd like to try to do some of

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
that.
