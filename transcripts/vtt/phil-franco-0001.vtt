00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a card from the public library here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Neighbor. All right thank you. Years.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Very much

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so I was born here in one thousand nine hundred five I was born

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on Skillman Avenue where well I was born in a hospital but my family lived on Skillman

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Avenue where my mother still lives

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
today and I think a lot of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the the interesting points of growing up here really became clearer

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to myself and to my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
friends as we grew up and began to know the experiences of other

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
people in different neighborhoods and how unique. Ours was it was very unique to grow

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
up in Italian Williamsburg and the reason I say Italian wings of Earth

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because Williamsburg is a very large place and there's many different enclaves of different

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
ethnicities and groups

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the Italian section where we lived was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
very unique in that it was somewhat insular.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I can tell you and my friends would definitely corroborate this everyone knew everyone.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I grew up on a block where there were many children

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
about my age.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And basically we grew up it was almost like a growing up in a very tight knit community

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
where you know we would be in and out of each other's houses every day everyone knew everyone.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You really couldn't get away with anything. I mean

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
if if I was home doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing you could be certain that the neighbors.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Would be talking to mom and things like that. There was a lot

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
of outdoor activity. Meaning that growing

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
up I guess this cultural kind of everywhere these days because

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of video games and the internet but. We were constantly on the street

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and playing ball or whatever on the Johnny. Fire hydrant

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
as Brooklynites might say.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So I think the vivid memories really in general would be very close knit community.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Everyone either was related by blood or marriage

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and you know there was a strong sense of camaraderie that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
lasts throughout like so

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that you could be certain that the vast majority of people

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
who grew up together. Keep in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
touch with their sense of family which is actually a very

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
cultural thing and it's. For

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
talian the neighborhood concept is something very unique for Italians.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Even those who have moved away would still consider this their neighborhood.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So that's something that transcends just Williamsburg it's a very cultural thing

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
for Italians

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
where especially southern

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Italians the fans the family was the one unit that was

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
trusted and the neighborhood made up like

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a network of families. And that would be trusted far and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
above any government institution or anything like that. So we kind of took care of each other and.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We're constantly together and really

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
associated more with neighborhood and family than

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with any

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
other possible identification. So we were from the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
neighborhood would be a phrase that would be used frequently.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And with a very specific

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
meaning like if someone was from the neighborhood it meant they were from a town in

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Williamsburg and they there was a immediate connection and immediate camaraderie

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
there. So. More specific memories

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and well just let me give you an

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
example most of the people that I grew up with on the block whether it was

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
going to have any or for a while we live in Jackson Street right here in the vicinity of this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
library every one of us. To keep in touch whether it be through the Internet

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
or physically.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You almost exclusively marry someone from the neighborhood.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
My wife grew up right across the tree from the library

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
actually so as we got older and we began to kind of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
branch out

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and it was then that we began to realize that there was a certain insularity to it

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
where you know people who grew up in other areas.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Sometimes don't understand the camaraderie and the connection.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And the real sense of identity with each

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
other I remember I worked with a woman who once said to me you know I grew up in Jackson Heights.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
She said if I met someone else from Jackson Heights I probably wouldn't know who they were and if I

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
did we would not be sitting around. Reminiscing about growing up in Jackson Heights.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Whereas with Williams Very good very

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
unique you would do that you would immediately connect and you would immediately.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Have a certain bond. Even if you didn't necessarily know the person well.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
There's a strong sense of community

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
there which I think today in

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
general is kind of lacking whether it be here or anywhere else.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But you for better or for worse

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you kind of knew everyone's business on the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
block and it was in general it was very much an

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
open community in

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that you know people in and out of each other's houses we had block parties frequently.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So no one was really an outsider.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Maybe maybe you didn't know the people a few blocks away but there was still a connection there because they

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
were from the neighborhood and you went to the school with them and.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So what I see lacking now just from my perspective like where I live

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
or even among the children in my school

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
principal is that sense of connection and that sense of community.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I think that's partially cultural in terms of our popular culture.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You know kids today make play dates that there was no such thing that you just rang

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
somebodies bell and. When in the house it was just expected.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Whereas today they'll make appointments and they tend to be more inside

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I live in Queens now and

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I can honestly say we really we've been there for eleven

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
years and really don't know the neighbors very well I mean maybe to say

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.000
hello

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
so. But although our children are growing up on that block we my wife and

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I discuss a drastic difference in their neighborhood experience from what we

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
have there. Yes My wife

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is my wife is also from the neighborhood here she is Italian.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
She is half nobly done and half facility and. So when

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
my grandfather who was from Naples found out that she was Sicilian he immediately told me

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to sleep with one eye open.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He didn't he didn't like.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
But by the time he got to know very well not about loving her very

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
much so we actually met in the

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
feast in Mount and it's kind of a typical Williamsburg story where we

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
met in the neighborhood in the feast we knew each other from a distance for years.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You know I remember when she was like seven or eight years old

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and. You know I knew her parents before I knew her. So it was a

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
very typical neighborhood type of

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
situation. And yes she grew up here as well although

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
she went to a different grammar school her memories would be very

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
similar and. You know this particular block where we are right now was where she

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
would hang out with her friends and.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Just. And she had a very similar experience although a few years younger although in a

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
different school. She would say the same about the neighborhood

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and comradery.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Everywhere. There's a lot of characters in the neighborhood as well they were growing up.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Everyone had a nickname particularly the generations before us.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You know the joke was that if you yelled out the word Anthony. Five hundred people would turn around.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So most of the time people have nicknames and usually they were colorful some of them I probably should

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
repeat it would give you you know you would know who these people

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
are and to this

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
day I know them by their nicknames in some cases they're people I've known for forty years and

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I don't know their

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
first.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So that was a part of the culture of the neighborhood as

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
well so. So that's really.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
You know there was a. I mean I was a

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
relatively little boy but I

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
mean there was several times

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
where. My. My mom was a single mom.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So if I happen to go home and my instruction was to do my homework immediately but instead I was

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
outside playing ball.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
There was no way around the fact that she was going to find that out and she did find out many times because

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
that the kind of like a Nietzsche arcs of the block in the warmer

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
weather would always be out watching

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
us and for good better or worse they would tell Mom everything that you did so

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.000
she would know if I

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
didn't do my best something like that I was I was just outside

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
playing. She would know what time I

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
went in to do the homework to try and do it before she got

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
home the general rule was particularly in the summer the general was once

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the street lights went on you start hearing moms out the windows yelling.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So if I was making believe I didn't hear her I was going to get around that because everyone else or.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Yeah there was a lot of that type of thing.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I remember

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
even in my younger days like maybe eight or nine years old where I was not

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
yet permitted to cross the

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
street and if I did with my friends. She found out more than once that I did

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
so I was a

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
scuffle.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Here. When I think of the friends that I grew up with it's

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
about fifty fifty there was

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
a Over the last few years as we've gotten. Married and started to have children.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Most of us couldn't afford to remain in the area which is really gentrified a

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
lot in the general trend was for people to move to Middle Village.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So there are a lot of people in Middle Village in my immediate vicinity who are from here. I would

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
say about fifty percent. Particular stayed

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
here particularly those who maybe they already own the buildings or they had an

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
empty apartment in the mom's building.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So I do find myself here in the neighborhood pretty frequently to visit. Even my mom my

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
in-laws still live here on the street not

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
devotion yet.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And so I would say about fifty percent of the friends I grew up with still live

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
in the neighborhood.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But even they will lament how quiet the block is.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
There's not many kids playing outside and.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You know the different changes that have taken place and believe it or not some of those Mitri arks

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
are still around sitting and now they're in their eighty's we thought they were old you know twenty five

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
thirty years ago now they're in their eighty's but they still sit out on the block and so there's still

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
a percentage of us.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Yes.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Mt Carmel is kind of been a micrometer was founded in the hundreds for

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Italian immigrants.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It was what at the time was called a national church. Meaning that it didn't

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
have specific geographical boundaries it was for a particular

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
nationality one of the reasons that was necessary was because in the United States with all the

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
different immigrant groups.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Different groups were not necessarily always welcome.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So whereas the local parish church may have been predominantly Irish or

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
say. They really didn't want the Italians and

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
their you know unique because Allah says them and their statues and their

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
perceptions and the.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Italians have a very emotional dramatic expression of their religion.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Whereas. The Irish culture

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
would be a lot more

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
somber So national churches were founded so growing up we always went

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
to Mount Carmel Church.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Which was always like that because of that fact was always really central to the Italian

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
community there were some other

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Italian parishes in the area but it was

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
always particularly because of the famous feast it was always very

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
central So I was an altar server there and grew up there. Many of my friends went there either to

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
the school or to the church. So it's been been there as part of my life since

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
day one.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yes

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
my first time I was on the executive

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
board which is people talk about the Supreme Court being on the executive board of the

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
feast is the highest honor anybody could be appointed

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to I was a Turk. Actually while I was in service when

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I was in front of thousands of people proposed to

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
my

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
wife thinking that she couldn't say no one thousand people.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Because we had met in the feast and we had our first official conversation the

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
feast first date sprung to take her to the feast which is free

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and so you know we both were volunteers there and I thought it

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
would be a good idea

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to while I was the target. It's difficult to explain but the

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
churches the pageants of the faeces the Giulio I don't know

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
how much you know about that

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
it did you know is a four ton eighty five foot structure

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that's carried. Through the feasts and it's it's a very beautiful pageant to see it's

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
not something you could really discuss. It's something you have to witness to it. Appreciate you

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
know imagine the Washington Monument just bouncing down the street.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But it's accompanied by a boat that's almost as heavy and then reenacting.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The reenacting to turn return of Sam to his town of

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
NOLA and he was on a boat so that's the reenactment and the people who read it him with.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Giulio means Lily in Italian so the people greeted him with ours a little so every

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
year man is chosen

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
to reenact the Bopara of the Turks so that was my role that

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
year and that's why I had

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the opportunity to publicly

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
propose that was my way of happen. Saying it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Absolutely.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Well

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
the neighbors as I got older and

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
things began to change in the neighborhood and we began to all of us I

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
think began to interact more with people from other parts of the neighborhood which

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
for us seem like other nations we began to realise how unique

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
our experience was.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
At least for someone growing up and then teenagers. You know maybe people in the forty's and fifty's said you

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
need those similar experiences but our neighborhood was kind of old fashioned even in

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.000
the eighty's and

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
ninety's. So I was very interested in studying that and

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
appreciating it more and as things started to change. I guess it brings you to a greater appreciation

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
of what you had.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So I went to

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Fordham and I was throwing around different ideas with my mentor. He said you know you

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
usually wind up your dissertation you want to

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
writing about yourself and some way shape or

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
form and we can we got to talking about the feast.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
most and how it was really a magnet for the young men in the area the young people and.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Mt Carmel is unique in that you would have a lot of men involved in the parish culturally Italian men

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
generally are not involved in

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
religion but one of the reasons for that I felt with the feet.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So I studied Italian American popular religion. And the way in

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
which it kind of incorporate. Young people into the church and into the Catholic

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
culture that wound up being a dissertation because of

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that and it's really that popular religion.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Meaning things like the feasting that the people do that are not necessarily coming

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
from the institutional church.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
That's very unique to Kalyan. Collison and it's one of the

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
reasons we won the national church

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and some of the more traditional groups like the Irish they wanted no part of

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
that they didn't like the perceptions and you know very dramatic drummer in

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
the fireworks and Julio

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and so that's how we wound up with places.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
He's

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
writing.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Well one of the things that was surprising was as we

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
interviewed interviewed about one hundred young men particularly women as

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
well but mostly the majority of them are

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
men who have different age levels have been involved in the parish and the feast and.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Their experience of the feast really.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Regardless of the hierarchy of where they list

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
it is

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
what has been essential in making them part of the

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
church in other words you know they identify themselves

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
as Catholics as Italian

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Catholics and a certain level of pride there and a certain level of religious practice it doesn't necessarily

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
mean that

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
devout but it usually stems from their involvement in the popular religion in

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
the feast more so than going to a Catholic school more so

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
than religious education classes. It was their socialization

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
into the faith through the feast that really affected their lives. Any build Vaughn's and help

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
build a neighborhood sense of camaraderie and community

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
that probably helped make

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
the neighborhood what it was. In the sense that like. My previously mentioned friend who said you know

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I grew up in Jackson Heights

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
and she just doesn't see that come around to read that.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So I think the feast has been a very big part of

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
that most of them return even if they moved to Queens or an island

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
at least to be involved in the feast. If not every Sunday. And I think

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
in many ways that was kind of the glue that made the camaraderie and the whole the neighborhood together for many

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
years. And we're doing.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
To you and that

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
are so

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
many yes.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Well

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
it's interesting everyone ask me that because the joke in the diocese among all the priests is if

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
you live in Queens Why are you studying for Mount Carmel.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
When I was younger I seriously considered becoming a

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
priest a lot of the priests in the neighborhood were very influential in my life I grew

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
up basically without a dad and. The priests in Mount

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Carmel particularly when I was a kid the pastor was a

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
huge figure in the neighborhood. It was very

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
traditional Going back to what we were discussing before

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
where someone of the neighbor had a

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
problem being of that southern Italian culture. You didn't go

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
to psychiatry's you didn't go to the police you didn't go

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
to you know you went to the priest and he was very much a father figure to the neighborhood.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So as a

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
young student I seriously was considering becoming a priest even into college.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And then I met my wife and she seduced me and. So I decided not to become

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
a priest but I still

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
felt a strong call to

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
be involved in the church and be active and try to

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
do you know a little bit more than.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You know the average involvement was something I always felt a strong call to

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
do and deacons can be married.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So as time went on I was certain that maybe that was what. I should be doing.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And because of our connection to the neighborhood. My wife and I and

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
my three children.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
We always continue to come back here on Sundays to serve it to be

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
a. First of all because of that family camaraderie that we're talking

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
about and also because our family still live here too. Coming on Sunday for the pasta

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Anyway that's still a big deal in the neighborhood

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
here. So I asked Mt Carmel to sponsor

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
me even though I live in the geographical boundaries of another parish in

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Queens and so far. Everybody's been OK with that the bishop gave his

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
OK So God willing I would be as one somewhere doing that. Maybe I would be assigned to my home.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
It's a long process a very good one. It's a five year

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
process because I really had the doctorate in theology needed to get

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
me some of the classes because I was actually I taught some of those

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
courses so they were like you don't have to take those so for me it's been a three year

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
program and there's days where it's intensive two nights a

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
week class one Saturday I'm on several retreats required per year.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's been a very positive experience a great great classroom with a lot of great guys

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
we carpool together. Through each step of the process the

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
church requires that you

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
have and this is the word that you have permission so she has to give

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
permission for you to join the program

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
just yet. So for the last three years I've been really nice to my wife trying to make sure that

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
she and then come the day of ordination the

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
week before she has to meet with the bishop and just to say that. This is not in Perth

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
a marriage or anything like that and just assign her permission again. So that's been a good

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
bonding experience this is something that the wives have to go to as well. Retreats and

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
things and but for the most part it's the guys that go on the classes and retreat.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I think it's helped me and I love the. Ariens of working in Williamsburg.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
I'm bringing it's interesting as a deacon you usually involved in the parish where

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
you live and grew up. So I'm bringing today for example I'm

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
bringing ashes to people that remember me when I was in diapers

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and sometimes that could be a good thing or sometimes you're giving actually to someone and they're like remember

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the time I broke my window with a baseball.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
So that's that's and I say my mom lives across in the church and bringing her

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
ashes today because she recently had hip surgery

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
so it's a nice experience it's kind of like a homecoming in the sense to work with

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
people that you know but then there's also a great opportunity as the neighborhood changes to try and reach out

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
to newer people and let them know they're welcome and let them know that there is a place here for them and.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
So you want to balance the two. So that's been a great experience so far.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
It's.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Something.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Sure

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
I can only speak specifically to Mount Carmel really. I know a number of the local churches

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
are trying in different ways to reach out. Mt Carmel which

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
has trying to balance really really trying to balance the

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
traditional Italian. Identity that we have but also at the same

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
time let people know they're

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
welcome. As the neighborhood began to change. Especially in

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
the ninety's you know the first wave

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
of change a lot of artists were coming in so we've tried to

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
do things that might appeal to them. We've

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
allowed the pastors allowed. Anything from comic book shows

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
to just playing of course that people

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
made. There is a theater company now that the parish has it has put on some excellent

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
production and. Quality stuff. I mean they don't just get like the

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
local kid who wants to be in a play I mean they really do auditions and then some quality thing.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Just to try and let people know that they're welcome.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And one of the things that I've been

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
doing. Is what's called the theology on

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
tap and basically you have

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
a talk about a particular topic in religion but at a local

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
bar and one of the one of the things that Williamsburg does not lack

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
is so I had to make the sacrifice and sample each bar

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
and it was difficult it was so and you know some of them a very open they give us

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.000
the back room

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and it's it's a national program and it's not something that Brooklyn

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
came up with but.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Actually originated in Chicago but that's been pretty successful in letting people know that

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
they're welcome we have Sunday night Mass now to appeal to the people who might not be up early in

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
the sun there and that's been working out pretty well so you do see a lot of new

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
faces in the church

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
and basically just to be both welcoming and inviting inviting

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
in the sense that not just wait for people to come to you

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
but you know let them know that they're invited to come in and look at things

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
and I think personally

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
the

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
different. Productions that have been put on I think those have

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
been successful in letting people at least know that we're

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
not adversarial you

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
know there's so many new people in the neighborhood

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
with many of them may or may not have a Catholic background may

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
have they may not be particularly religious but it's just a sense of letting them know

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
that you know we're here for you and you're welcome.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I think it was done a good job of trying to balance the

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
two you know to be a traditional Italian welcoming place in terms of

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
the feast and. We still have a tiny mass on Sunday there is still a decent population

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
of Italian speakers who come to that

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
now but at the same time trying to show everybody that they could be part of the place.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I believe the feast is a tremendous way of doing that because you have thousands of people are just

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
walking through to see what it's about and make them feel welcome and invite them

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
in so.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Well

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I would say the been many changes some good some not so good

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
the just generally speaking the population is obviously increased tremendously.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
When we were growing up my friends and I sometimes and I hate to say this

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
but sometimes we would

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
be hesitant to say we were

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
from Williamsburg because people associated

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
with the south side which had a lot of gang activity and drug

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
problems we when we went to high school I remember my friends discussing the fact that

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
people didn't know what Williamsburg

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
was we had absolutely no chain stores of any kind

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
in Williamsburg there was no Burger King McDonnell's Dunkin Donuts Starbucks nothing.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It was kind of like people didn't know we were

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
here and for the most part we didn't mind that we were insular

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
we liked our neighborhood we liked being together and.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
So therefore sometimes we would tell people we were from Greenpoint because

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
we border. The Italian section of Williamsburg bordered on

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000
replying and people generally had a better view of Greenpoint or they at least heard of it.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
But now with the changes. It's become trendy it's one train stop from

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Manhattan the property values have more than quadrupled.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And now it's a trendy popular thing to say you're from Williamsburg

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
and the joke that we had was that we knew it was cool. Before anyone else

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
realized that. You know the population has changed drastically I think one thing that's been lost.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
It's good to have the increased value real estate wise it's good

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
to you know the neighborhood.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I mean the crime was never really a problem but that really hasn't changed

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
either. It's a lot more difficult to park than it ever

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
was before and but I think one thing that's kind of been lost

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
because of the population explosion.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
It's been like that sense of community and camaraderie.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Now I look at the block I grew up on a least half the people I don't know.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
People kind of keep to themselves. So it's not all

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
bad but you definitely lose that sense of community and neighborhood.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
There is a certain anonymity that's come out of it almost similar to like a

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
big part of Manhattan something.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
My mom would say that the bar on her corner which plays music till two am is not good either

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
but so I think that sense of community

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
maybe being lost a little

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
bit.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
You know. I think there's still remnants of a time when

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Americans. I think many of the I don't even know that sometimes are

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
called hipster I don't know I don't want to say

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
anything sero insulting but many of them seem to have a nice genuine

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
curiosity about the traditions of the neighborhood that I really haven't come across any

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
animosity from them.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
The feast. Thank God has been preserved and continues to do

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
well we have some very famous Italian restaurants like the Monte

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
that continue to

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
flourish. So I think things have been preserved

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
this especially in regard to the churches and the

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
fees. It's still a huge tourist attraction. We get

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
approximately last year's estimate was over twenty five thousand people during the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000
course of the festival not necessarily at one time but at least twenty five thousand.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
On the day of the Julio we

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
get almost fifteen ten to fifteen thousand pending on the

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
weather. So. I mean that's a that's a big

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
day so I think that has been preserved and hopefully will continue to

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
be. And like I said it there's been a

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
genuine friendliness I guess.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Jen they like the quickness of it the artistry

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
the video is a wonderful example of focal

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
art. For Italian culture so that's something that they new people tend to be interested in.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
In fact the Brooklyn Arts Council did something about our folk art in the manner in which the

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Julia was

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
constructed. So that's been good and I think those things have

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
been retained and probably will

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
be. But there is in the parishes have

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
become commuter parishes in the sense

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
that as I look around the home like on a Sunday. Probably a quarter of

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
us are driving in from Middle Village or Glendale or mass the

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
different parts of Queens which are not far away but it's not the same.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000
So. Yeah. Madge.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I just think it's very difficult

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
to express in words the uniqueness of what it was to grow

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
up in Italian Williamsburg.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
It was about a centuries worth of you know immigrants here

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
from particularly from the turn of the century in the twentieth century and.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
One of the most unique things. There is a Facebook group called the

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
neighborhood and it's basically people reminiscing about growing up in Williams

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Italian

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Williamsburg and they have different political viewpoints they have different ages they have

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
different experiences but the

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
most unanimous aspect of the thing that unites all of them

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
is over two thousand members on

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
the page is the

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
uniqueness of growing up here and.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Positiveness you know it was

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
just a wonderful experience. They would not give

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
up if someone said to me you know you can do it all over again to grow up in a very rich

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
wealthy neighborhood in a mansion.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I wouldn't I wouldn't change it I mean the friends that I grew up with. They're still here with me

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
and

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I wouldn't want to have any other experience as a child and.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
So there was just a sense of safety a sense of connection.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Really a sense of family I think that's probably lacking in the average neighborhood today anywhere you go.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
So there are still Italian enclaves.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
But even they have become more modernized and individualized. And I

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
think we were very lucky at least my generation to be probably the

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
last to grow up in Italian Williamsburg

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
where even my children won't see that beautiful connection to others and.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
At least not the same way we

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
did. Maybe they see it during the feast. But it's something

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
I would never give up I think is very formative.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
More so than any formal education just.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
That even today I mean we just people stick together from

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Williamsburg

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and if the joke. I'm a principal now in the Queen's.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
School and it's in Middle Village and the joke is you know.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
So who did you hire this week from Williamsburg you know

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
so kind of that that loyalty to each other

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
and trying to help each other out and.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
That automatic connection and I almost feel bad for my kids because they're

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
not getting that same neighborhood experience that we have.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
So I'm just babbling now right.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
My pleasure thank

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
you.
