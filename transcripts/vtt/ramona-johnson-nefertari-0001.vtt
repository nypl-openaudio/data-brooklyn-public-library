00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
OK so. Here

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
they are talking with. For our

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
story project and Today's are necessary.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As well so yeah.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My experience in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Brooklyn like memorable. I was here all my life

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was born and raised in Brooklyn. I was raised. I was

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
born in the original section of Brooklyn which is a mixed neighborhood.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
African-American and mostly to neighborhood at that time was like

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Tino and talian and then from

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
there we moved to Park Slope which is like a melting pot and you would find

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
all different races in Park Slope you can find you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
know blacks Hispanics all dishes just a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
mixture

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and so you know I guess some people consider Park Slope a very upscale

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
neighborhood and then from partial I moved to Brownsville

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and so this is very different this a really urban neighborhood and then

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
from Brownsville. I found

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
myself here and she said that. Yeah I don't know what Pfizer is where they

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.000
are these

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
places as I say I'm a ten year.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
One and because you know approaching my safety and so I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
probably I've been here nine years and I was in Park Slope nine years and I grew up and I was

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in Ridgeway for nine years some like that so you

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
know I had the visa for like where where you're at when you're at each of those places.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And what your experience of the neighborhood

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
were OK and growing up in bridge were broke when it was.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You know old school. You know I'm a pilot

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of the late sixty's and so it was very much a

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
community and in the truest sense.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Everybody went. Everyone's spouse everyone but we everyone looks

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
out for each other we play we each other on the block we all had the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
same dinner time. We was we all had the same place

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
on and so everyone knew where everyone was so it was easy to go to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
other people's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
homes and what is it like

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
going to school their memories

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of growing up and growing up in the area. It was a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
very protected neighborhood because all of the adults watched Alsace

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and so you know that I had a sense of adults what dolls and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
children with

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
children and children stayed in their place and I felt protected. I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
did feel protected. I think

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that you know when you come from a big community and you know everyone you know we didn't have

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
any of that like gang violence and things that N.H.L. A Everybody pretty much looked out

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
for you when we lived together and we went to school to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
get me I mean they were gangs in different communities like East New York Brownsville. But

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
it was and is violent and is prevalent and so you know just

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
sounded like it is now you know

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
like it's crazy but I think that things

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
have changed because you know that was back in the early seventy's that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm talking about when I was the original Brooklyn and so back in the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
early seventy's. You know we're just coming up or for the sixty's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in that whole sixty's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
movement civil rights and all that kind of stuff so you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
know people flower children bell bottoms I was Wayne Bell bottoms

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and stuff like that and you know it was a different hour. And

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
so now as

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we move along you know urban life

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
is developing and you know you get in a concrete jungle students are doing

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
all kind of thing you

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
know and they have been. And they gather there's a breakdown of the family that all whole community thing I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
was telling you about started to diminish people started to go to work moms used to be at

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
home in like early seventy's and then as you progress

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
on it today.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
A.B.C.. You know I think people pretty much started like. Both parents probably started

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
working away I saw

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it in your own life your whole life

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but this is a well I had a stay

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
at home mom but

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
by the time we moved in we got the parks Well you know it was hustle and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
bustle and it was like you know you and miss middle

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
school and you know that you see you get a new approach

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
in high school and life is changing and there's hustle and bustle

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and finding high schools and all kind of thing so you know.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The transition

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
was a very big one coming from you know original Brooklyn and

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
then wired up impacts well then everyone

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
so serious and everyone's about a career. It's a big

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
change yeah yeah. And you said you are living.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And then I moved to Brownsville which is a really big change because you

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
know there are a very urban neighborhood like never talk or you say it's

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
a gang is violence is drugs issues

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and and. You know that really

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
put fear into me because you know kind of live like a sheltered life

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
until then even though I live in a mixed neighborhood I never really experience

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
racism and isolation but in Brownsville. I did that's when I became

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
aware that racism is a serious problem in Brooklyn you know and you

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
would think it is but you know each section of Brooklyn is different so if I went

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to you know. You know how would be we had the incident with

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the young man do you remember his name. I can honestly more fun he was running than

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
a car meaning it's been a

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
bad

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
start when I say it sounds to me I'll tell you but you know in this juice you know

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
it's a melting pot you have Chinese

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
here you have

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of Hispanics beer Attalia fear

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and everyone claims destruction and you know it's a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
very curious place it's a mountain tired of people but it's very territorial.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Yeah because if I go in a block and I go to this Pakistani neighborhood I did

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.000
care

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
either you but I mean you don't like just stop you right usually.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
You know and she says you know sometimes everybody to my Avi

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Zohar the store you know what a different culture you know you can some people can

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
be self-centered that you feel intimidated and just go to go when you don't use you know you divide.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
You know make you turn around and not mothers or do certain stores on Ocean Avenue.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
If I go there I will go to early in the morning like you know soon as the sun comes up and I know they do open I

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
go and get my vegetables and I'm out of there because I know the attitude.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Of Deputy cologne. I know which stores. Well I mean I mention the neighborhood. You know in the city but at

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that but you

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
know and also like when you hear people

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
money like if I hand you a twenty dollar bill for my groceries. I don't

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
want you to Dole my money on the

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
counter and then the next person behind you to wonder and in front of me you didn't do

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that today and you understand so is your understanding dynamics of what I'm

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
saying from

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the you say you when you realize this racism but that is of

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the do of this of experience when I really like

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it well it became real to me because you

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
know it's our open neighborhood and you

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
know there's drugs the exile

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and this. Stereotypes and. You know I think many

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
people buy insists there are ties here in Brooklyn. Because that

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with the media

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
puts out a fact immediacy to whole lot of stuff this going

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
on where this Politics Show issues for when you know they hype it up

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because they want to Saunders favors in magazines. So if you really want to know the truth dealing

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
with scorn and you have to be involved with your community and you know not if you can you just got not

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as a rabbi going out and meet people you know and when I go to places if I

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
see free brochures object. One of everything up to bring it home for the readers like

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
a novel. That's the only way to go no

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I think that you're very right because you know you could get a perception

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that this is a very welcoming and open place

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Brooklyn is like never carries sayin. You know

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
maybe some of the perceptions about Brooklyn is driven by the media

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and that is Robin is all although well year to year is all oh

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
work is not does the media has a lot to do with a lot of negative stuff that

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is portrayed

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
in different neighborhoods. OK you don't really hear in media go out and say look

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
at these college student or look at these high school students who are volunteer and to

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
cancel you know cancer hospital or volunteer for children hospitals

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
are nothing to do children now as I'm marching to do things are not taking place but you do

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
have children and tunics and

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
young you dead are doing exceptional things and nobody talks about it unless it's a

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.000
group of

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
people like these young ladies here who were going inside the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
trenches you know to really she was gone and

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
exposes. You know the same life for us as a people

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
we don't hear about college tours the less you listen the W.B. LS For W.L. I'd

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
be. OK you know their college tours but we're talking about

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
college talk like that so we don't have enabled opportunities to a lot of things and are saying give

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
me stuff on a silver platter because I don't. Kids and I MAKE THEM WHERE

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
WAS THERE WE GO TO changes because we're you know as we were talking about

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Brooklyn so my mind is in a different place Kate will be really talking

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
about what you're talking about as being a black person living in

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Brooklyn. OK Wendy radio talk about that. No I'm saying

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
this is all good to me right. This is good

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
but you know you know I want to direct my my conversation because I

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
was had a certain train of thought and I was thinking about what my experience

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.000
was growing

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
up but I don't like we were talking about racism so it

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
is appropriate because you

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
know you are tapping into you know your perceptions

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and experiences and you know that's important

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
this important the last things you said is true I think people see

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
things

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
on news won and channels to it

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
depends on what cable companies

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and so that is limited the media is very limited shows

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
limited neighborhood

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
shows Long Island arrives and most of things

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
S.-E. come from Long Island and I live in Brooklyn. So you

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
know it is strange and it doesn't seem right.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And it changes your perspective because if I'm seeing it every day and I start a so seeing

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
what I'm seeing

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
with Brooklyn but is really long island it could be considered bring more

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
action if you want to say you but you know I feel like not

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
enough news and people say that all the time because there's a lot of crime in Sheepshead Bay is

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
still the first thing people say is wise and on and

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
media is all around here you know what happened on Larry told me

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
they all kind of stuff. And so when necessary

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is saying is true because the police department once emitted dead. They.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The crime statistics why exactly is they were pre-trained them to be.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And so that you would think that most of the crime is

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
happening in places like Grand surreal in East New York when just as much

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
crime is happening here she said bay any not more so as.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You know all you have to just open up the bay news and you see what's going on and we see that people are

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
getting carjacked you really get the it's always amazing.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You will see that they get mugged at the subway station over the Internet a

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
bus stops on Ocean Avenue. You

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
know we're each year from April to the original of July. I

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
mean everyone you know one after another one would be an attack to bust up five six thirty in

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the morning. You know get a choke hold in between in one night and coming out of the

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
building and you

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
know and if we didn't password via phone call like she would call me or one of

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the other girl did you hear so much will happen to such and such address and what women you know

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
but when I'm out a deal so I stop on to dealing with like today

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
don't talk publicly and in our community. OK so it was just by word of mouth and I guess

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
it was a ramp

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the thing that was going on and I don't know this because you have two different sections of the night out here.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't know Desta reason why you

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
know it's not easy news is Camp suppressed.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
There was a newspaper and I want to tell you one is the baby news yet on its

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Korea life and she said they bite

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.000
puts a lot

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of the stuff that goes on in Niger development.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They those tree paper is a popular report in

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
which news one there than you and the rest the news

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
channels that we have out here but for the most part

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I live in here for the not the nine years I've been never tarries been here for much longer

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
than me.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
It's been a very good experience because we have the song. Marash we live by

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
marine park and we have a nature reserve center this is a

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
very secluded area and so that's why I say we like out here by the

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
water

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and it's a big difference from Brownsville is a much

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
better place in Brazzaville but it is still an isolated place

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and you know pretty much

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
this neighborhood is a makeshift like Russian you hear from anybody on

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
the Chinese. Irish you define everybody out here.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
You know is

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
a melon patch and for the most part people out

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
here especially if you're going to a Garrison Beach

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
because we're actually on the border. If you go a couple couple blocks

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
over will be in Garrison Beach and that there is a very racist prep

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
place for blacks and certain white because if you're not

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Irish then you're going to have

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
a problem. You know Marano about the ethnicity you know but I know I don't go down that way

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
soon because I mean people and I don't go down that way because the stories that I've heard. I mean

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
there's no stores down here for me I don't have all my kids are grown and what not but I just

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
don't venture down that way.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
if you know. There it reaffirms what I was saying that you know Brooklyn.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You know is outside of looking every night. Oh I want to go

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to proclaim it seems like such an exciting plan excuse you know there's

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
so much to different people but when you get here you find out there's so

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
many different dynamics going on this is a very

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
complex place.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But why. What made you move so she said a year after raising your son here

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
whether they're like.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Well I had a couple of choices and. I chose to come to she said

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
they because I like water.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And so we are by three bodies of water we got Plum Beach.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We guys. We have

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
it in the rain

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
part where I was saying in a nature reserve. That is the end of the Hudson River so that enter

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
the Hudson River and right here and she today.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
of course we have Coney Island there is bias. And there still Lana

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Goshen isn't it.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.000
If

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I started on the harbor. There.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Yes So I really was attracted by the quietness.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
There's a lot of green space here. And they seem like

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
such a nice play but what isolated.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
What made you leave came from Brownsville to

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
get. I came from handsome Basil because I want to do Billy get out of

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Brownsville because it was so much gun violence so much crime

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I drive. It's not it's not it wasn't a very good place

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
to raise a child so I have my youngest son

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
he's nine years old and then I have a oldest son. There's twenty six

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
years on so I was really lucky and to pretty much get my older

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
son away from that kind of

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
environment because to Basle was a place

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
with black teens would be getting shot every other day

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and you know you always say this is my son going to be next.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
have you a great year old as you say how different are

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
eighty year old are you.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I think my oldest is more street smart because it

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
is not an event going on here and she said they for the most

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
part and even the schools here. The schools are different my son goes

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
to a school and Gaston being too.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And if we were in Brownsville. It will probably be a C. on.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Because as you know many schools in urban areas the deal with minority children

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
or poor performing schools in S. a fact. So you know

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
there is a difference academically there's a difference. Socially. I think

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
socially my son is

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
more developed then my older son would have been I mean he

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
was exposed to a like a lot of

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
violence there. So

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
either you talk about other things about living.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Criticism or other areas. Well I

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
always would think as a community. You know we

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
don't have much out here. And she said that is really nothing much

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
has

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
no club down here. There's no do we have a movie theatre. It's about

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
it but net the next three

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
cinemas arning you know that was still going on and on to movies

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
on my D.V.D.'s out of my

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
home. You know I mean what do you

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
think the best my perspective I just feel that there's no in a

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
same area.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
It's not so much entertainment just nothing cultural for you down

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
here. Yes ma'am God is nothing out here for these you know like oh yeah you

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
know I don't you see young Sis get on a bus they dress to deny they going to work.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I'm tired to see a Muslim brothers hanging out on the corner. I know. OK I

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
do speak to you know I ticked all used to ask you because I used to volunteer one ninety

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
four I was a kindergarten kids I did after almost seven years on love into

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
death to see them now in high school or just to maybe go to college you know

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
and when I see them it makes my heart so

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
happy because you're on the right track and I always try to give them encouragement. They

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
don't get that a lot of the London dollar had responded ones that don't know me but most of the kids out here know.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Am I so

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
but in terms

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
of you can get job training for women any woman can go to

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
job training but you don't have nothing qualified for the brothers or the Latino or

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
the minorities crude and I want to just keep you know individually labeling. OK

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
so if you are night I'm not saying that a lot of the you

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
to not look a boy different but what do you have right here or does

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
nothing out it is not black churches like that so here

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
we don't have the one places that they don't want no Larry don't have our Ok this is already in

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
and I'll be no accounting for

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
like you know but it is totally. If you don't care if it's on

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.000
a parent.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Like I said I don't have money for tutoring I was a single parent.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
OK so I worked my kids as much as I could to keep them on point but they started school when he was three

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and four years old that in the sixty's when he started

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Headstart death of my children got in and then found a will for style in a put in a got a

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.000
better

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
education and I did a comparative thing I compared the books to my kid

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Ted Bundy other neighborhoods to what the children were doing in my neighborhood

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
totally

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
different totally different when I got to south poles to computers.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
There were no computers in East New York where I was raising my kids and when I went

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
to when. When I moved to bedside days are computer is because of Mom

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
fight to get them into a better school in S. what I told the parents when I was launching you don't have to come every

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
day I came five days a week from eight known until four thirty in

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
the afternoon. You don't give an

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
hour usage home and you vigil does not happen and what we're you.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Like I told the board of ed No one has to teach your child to write scripts so what

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
is everybody doing now pushing a D.M. but not a

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
device. OK Do you know how did you know like I said back in the day when I went to school

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
you knew how to do the dictionary. You know you know everything about the dictionary. MARION

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
SCRYMGOUR it's cool. Because the way he's as he's in Garrison

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Beach one ninety four was nitrogen and knew that when I first I was up for

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
all her greatest

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
work. I mean she does not ignore the script by you my kids knew how to

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
squeeze by by the time they were six and seven. OK I told my

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
kids can't speak correctly you couldn't come home with slime

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
where you can make in my kids were going to go Don't think just because my

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
kids went to a different Ariel school they got ridiculed they were to use on the school

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
bus and the kids laughter then when it came to the way the day talked which we learned how to talk

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.000
like

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
that because they spoke correct English and played it like I say you

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
gotta stop when you bring your kids home when he's really flustered not put a pencil in a

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
union talk to him. Don't you know in a God I babble babble so you got

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
to talk to him and you'd be

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
surprised children stimulate that you can see just when you stimulated the

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
a mind like I say now you look at that you look at the declassified is.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
The jobs not only want you to have a college degree you got to be

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
bilingual. So what did the black mayor. What did

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
he say on he's going to start a curriculum to teach

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
or you just now get into twenty parroting that our children should

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
be given a second language. OK from when

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
you when your preschool definite need to start once you start talking making Falconer you need to be taught

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
a different language. Know you not and I'm not saying you just give them a language use your

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
teaching or words to make you

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
know how you say in Spanish how you say it in English or

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
whatever and you'll get it just how you teach them where you show a red apple this. Apple

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
is red is shaped like you know well the word or this arches round you teaching

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
in the circle and you teach them the color of it you understand that it's not hard.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
We have been deliberately taken back with the education system in

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
the body it is just that under our. Oh

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:09.000
the part I was going. Why.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
This community

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
needs artistic. I think

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
there with we there's not enough cultural things going on I think we have a

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
lot of different cultural groups and no one's really doing

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
anything as far as culture like we don't have we have one community center than

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
there and it's Asian and they don't want anyone but. Asian people coming

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
in we need something that breaks all of these little quick

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
scene groups. And

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
that just brings people together late

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
a different type of community center that welcomes everyone from the community if you go

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
across the street you go to the Y. is the Jewish King's Bay why they only want to cater to

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Jewish people they only want to cater to Asian

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
people I had a and I had people be happy even to be happy in

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.000
these

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
conditions and even though I have the wire here you've got parents who can afford to take them to

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
why what is true this should be honest as you said you have a lot I don't get to go with after

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
you have to do what he did I was amazing I say would totally And then if I don't have the money going

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
to feed the meta data me wait for my men come

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
back what I think that was made she said a

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
better place is if we had more. Instead

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I have an

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
isolated specific specific cultural events is that if

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
we just had places that were for everyone and sort of just seven

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
places

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
for the Jews the Russians just everyone. And so.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Like Neff said we don't

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
have. Like we have to travel to go to Brooklyn music. There's

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
no artistic endeavors out here. There are no social

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
clubs out here. There's nothing

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
there's no love you know labor the whales are in the Gulf right now watching it not in a

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
little circle of well I mean like you know if

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
you go to partial there's a this five restaurant on every block.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Is they use them to do a lot of the alley and all that how you got the

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
drugstore wasn't a food

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
stance of hey you want to be for real and that my back in the

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
day when you had to build a guest on every corner you had a mom and pop clean a storage unit

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
head of a lot

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
of minorities that all of this is honestly none of our people are here

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
to have a one man store here on Ocean Avenue and I'm hoping that from Fulton

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
and Flatbush I mean flap was you know students are always down to visit except

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
the brother that just opened up his fish store on Avenue the why is

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
it birthday date and what is a business

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
day very again gave him a lot but you can count on one you David was how to end the

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
fish place on on on on Ave The Who else is out here.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Well for the most part I

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
was because we live in a house and still you

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
know we're like a handful of people like this Weiss

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
and begin and I feel like this is my neighborhood because you know.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I live in a

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
development and you know we work in the community nets it's been in the community for a long

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
time but the best death the truth I mean like

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
in order to accomplish with Nessus saying we would need our

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
own people to be more politically organized and they are

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
not yet it is very homey or they're like.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
The that would entail. Get in and

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
resources and exposing them to the political process.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.000
This is how to

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
build this is and things of that nature this

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
this suggest a whole different

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
example ballgame I. Because even though I vote now and vote has

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
I got it wrong.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
OK I don't really see a difference in a thing other than effect yes my brother

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
President Obama he's in office

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
but. The powers that be around him has made his

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
job of a zillion times harder than it needed to be because of who he is

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
well OK well what but on the other point when is volume time

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
enough community who do we see it evolve

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
polls know and out the little

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
man active role model so I know that al Qaeda is doing them out

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
when we went in when President Obama was

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
running our whole neighborhood came out. When the next

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
primary came in who was

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
vote the

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
elderly you understand what I'm saying the elderly were voting.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
OK And we need to understand debt and like I said I'm not a political person

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
but I'm learning as our goal or that if you don't get involved. You don't have

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
a voice for the shower of all parents and I'm sure you can be sure

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
you their own go into a opiate Cup wasn't to people came out in

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
this neighborhood and I know I

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
don't want it but it is the antithesis of eight

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
thousand people that live in our development and. You know if you think about the whole neighborhood

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
just barrels of people

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
but our politicians actually really win by several hundred votes in S. A

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
friend I was

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
just you don't know unless you work in an a poll worker so you and no one would

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.000
know

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
that that they went and bought a couple of hundred votes is is

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
this

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
is crazy but it's on monday through no one's coming out so

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
well and you never do as a primary a couple weeks ago. I happen to buy a deal years on ebay.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I don't even know today was a primary. I read a paper just I took magic newspaper

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
OK I saved it OK now these hold three a thing was six pages full of all kinds of

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
different judges and it wanted no pick

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
his I don't even follow from that I have carried that. Get off

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
the street if you want us to continue to vote but I have a

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
name doesn't mean nothing to me.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And this is how politically be able to spin the wheels the way did they

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
do. OK And then every election you come up all the paper punch

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
or did you know they got a key chain. Really you're going to me into a mood you can

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
fix the machine for the everybody gets a chance of

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
all the areas in Maine. If after nine when he can make a

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000
new decision. You did it has a hour to do absolutely nothing.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
The other way around for my landslide last on sight.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
No no no no no no no

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:50.000
no I'm just a conscious observer.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
But one less. So it's

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
about she said De Lay was when they work with made me

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
be happy to live here is that. If I did

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
see more businesses that were owned by people of color. If

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
I did that because I saw isolated I said that

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
before and people who feel that way. I don't think that the Asians will still isolated

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
because they have things geared towards

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
them but you know in the Russians because they had their stores or restaurants or

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
whatever but for me and mess as African-Americans. I

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
feel isolated I said this and to be given this the way I felt and so you know

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
that's important if I

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
had things that I lightly I like going to the

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
museums you know we have we do have a movie theater but there's not a lot

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
of places and people can go out here she said there's still you know the

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
kids feel that way too I know it is sure that they still my business and here

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
like in other neighborhoods like they read you can go to

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
these fun places for kids gym places

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
and you know for a dollar and but then again those places cost more. Me and everybody doesn't

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
have much use do we have a whole race of young children that are going with out on

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
the weekends because they have nothing to do in a payments can't afford

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
it. The switches they can't afford and like I said look at the car here.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
OK so my car six kids and I want to take my kids to the Brooklyn

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Museum and the donut. Because I noticed

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
and I'm sorry

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
the the. I don't know if this is all

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
be quiet.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Our goal because everything just I'm sorry I'm not sure it's something new when you are

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
making some very valid

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
points and I really appreciate is this conversation I

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
really love talking about Brooke was all really the same

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
day really appreciated. So thank you for sticking to you.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
OK.
