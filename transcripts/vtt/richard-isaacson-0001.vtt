00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Thirty five years. We moved here in ninety

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
one before that we had lived very

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
briefly in color.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When we first got married we were there couple for about a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
year and a half before we started looking for a house of mystery

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I'm married and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I know I grew

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
up in the Bronx thankfully and near Van

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Cortlandt Park. So I've always kind of lived near parks.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well life. Originally never been called a park then when I

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
lived in Manhattan for two or three years I lived near

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Central Park Police. The dad. And if I

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
got married a party was too small to preclude me from place A

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
little bigger and. That was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
affordable. And after the your there.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He started looking for us. And first came

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to Park Slope Well we were kind of in the middle of actually negotiating on our House

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and Capitol

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Hill and came to one of the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
concerts then shelled our Prospect Park

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and. Andy mediately fell in love with the neighbors and.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I told Mike you have to take a look

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
at.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Well the picture was very beautiful

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the park itself was a huge attraction

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
for the kind of activities everybody was.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Concerts and other activities. I think the first time I got my wife to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
come was to the house tour that was being run by

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the parks and civic Council all the time. And really enjoyed that a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
lot. And you could see there were a lot more neighborhood

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
organizations than we were used to seeing in the the Manhattan or the part of Brooklyn

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
were. At first living in this place and that was another to get

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
traction and. While we were still in the process of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
buying the house that we eventually will which is on sixteenth

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Street

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
between the eighth Avenue in Prospect Park West.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We where we are to never found out about this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
organization called rogue stuff.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's called. Revitalization of the southern area of the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
slip and.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We joined that actually before we even finished firing.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because we were interested in finding out more about the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
neighborhood. You'll

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
say well they were. They were originally formed.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The original name was revitalization of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the son of seventh Avenue

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
South and the original idea

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
was to there were a lot of vacant stores south of ninth Street

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
at the chili. There's actually a big division in the neighborhood between.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The more developed parts of the Park Slope in the north

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and in the central part would be

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
even the original housing stock was a little more serious.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But the whole part of Park Slope had actually

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
gone downhill by in the. Sixty's and early

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
seventy's and during the brownstone

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
revival

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
movement there was already a lot of fixing up of houses in the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
north than Central Park

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
where this is some of the houses seem to be

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
more interesting introduce the details in the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
architecture but there were plenty of good houses in the southern part of the slope it just had been a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
little bit more of a working class neighborhood

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
originally. But when we started being

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
interested in moving to the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
slope the really what we could afford the real estate agents told us to look in

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the water look in

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the south.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And I think there was even the store or my wife doesn't remember it twice to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
be remember that it was either a store or restaurant

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
around ninth Street. That was called South of the border

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
because there was such a marked distinction at that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
time and over the years I think

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that distinction is kind of governor raced and.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You know our There was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
a real sense of there was a the Park Slope

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
City Council had been active for. Probably over a hundred

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.000
years in

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Brooklyn and they were much more concerned

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with that central and northern area of the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
sloop discussed kind of where they were located and roast us.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Was probably formed partly because they felt that the other part of the slope was

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.000
being

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
neglected and there were more vacant storefronts towards the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
south.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Well originally they were just trying to promote.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
More development in the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
area more development of the store fronts never. It wasn't just a promoter.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
More of a sense of community and to focus on community problems. But

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
eventually by the.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
One. Now it's starting in one thousand eighty three they formed the idea

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
of forming an elegy

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
seeds and getting together a project to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
actually provide along

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
with the shopping strip along Seventh Avenue.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And from eighty three to eighty six. You know.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
They were working to get funds from the city and state which we eventually got.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And those funds were used to provide matching funds

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
for people who wanted to upgrade their

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
strong front foot in

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
security and also providing funds for putting in tree planting

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
trees and garbage receptacles to.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
One of the things that they did was booklet of guidelines

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
for storefront

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
relevation which had the intention

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that to prevent like really Gary

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
shorefront from being created along to create a more

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
uniform sort of feel on the

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
street

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
you know as suggested guidelines it was a new news. No way to require anything but I think a

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.000
lot

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
of merchants were very receptive to that idea of making it a

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
more attractive strip along that

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
area.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Uses. How did the problem was we were very successful during the run

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
of the project

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
which but then around eighty seven. City.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Back on funds for the seasons area

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and I think there was kind of a political thing going on too between the city

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
council and the borough

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
president the borough president said had their own

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
funding discretionary funding cut by the mayor's

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
office relation and

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the City Council is trying to get people to work through them rather than through

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the borough presidents

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and and when they did do that for a president

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
golden apparently was not too happy with that and the Enter just cutting

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
off funds pretty some similarity to the number of the L D C's a

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
ten point.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So our project. The rule. We had had a project director we

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
actually had a store front

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
lines seventh Avenue which we

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
had

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
gotten very cheaply from but we

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
had we had to fix it up ourselves and sweat equity solicits.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And we had a project director who is very good excellent

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and really marvelous things we helped form of

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Merchants Association. Along slowly in the stricter.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And they did promotion shopping promotions need.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And the idea really what is that playing making us strong for the

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
spine long seventh avenue that would also help development

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
or the rest of the

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
neighborhood. So after that brand we started to

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
do get more involved in other smaller

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
projects. We had a

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
newsletter that. Provided information

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
on various aspects of which

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and researching your building history kitchen.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So there wasn't a

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
very widely distribute was distributed mostly within the membership because we really

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
didn't have a lot of funds to do. But we started

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000
having fundraisers which you're the first couple were.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Around Christmas time a holiday arts and music festival in the

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
armory

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
use method we used to have most of

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
our meetings in the officers' club of the

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
armory. And chill

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
of the armory passed away from National

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Guard control and then the city had taken over for a while and

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
then eventually it was turned over

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
to there's a lot of controversy over the army over the

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
years both because of the homeless shelter there and because

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of what was what we're going to be the plans for after the

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
city bowed out of running

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
it and

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
where it ended up being eventually being.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Managed well actually has two things going on it is still a homeless shelter

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
there and we were very influential in keeping.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The population there kept it for a long time. Was kept at

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
seventy when there.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
There was an attempt at one point to turn it into an

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
assessment center which would have had of people just coming

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
transiently for short periods in another. And we were able to keep it as

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
a kind of more not permanent home

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
but more of a long term thing where people could actually feel

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
like they're part of the community

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it's There was a lot of controversy over the shelter there

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
because there were some groups

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that were adamantly opposed to having anybody there and all

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that raised a lot of Cannick of. I mean a lot of

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
crime and is easy courses.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And they were to the shelter

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and most of the residents were not thrilled at having the shelter there

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but. We were trying to make it something manageable.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
That wasn't threatening.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Eventually the city finally turned the management of

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
or the shelter over to a nonprofit camp.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And I would say that they don't excellent job of managing

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I think I think things are pretty

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
solidly down about. I don't think their people get too upset

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
if you suddenly heard that there were plans to expand it. I'm sure

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:01.000
you get people getting mad again each.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Well

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
we have most of the time there

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
was. Either co-presidents or president and vice president.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Mike Rice was the longest

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
serving president of recess.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I think he had about

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
seven dreams.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And his ear.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And there were we were not founding members of it.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I think probably the two most influential people in the Row

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Source were a couple called Carlin you see Judy Carson

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in this they were there from the

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
start calling the architect

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
he also was involved with the park for the civic unfolds and he was

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
kind of our liaison with the Civic Council as well is doing

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
various roles through

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
such and his wife was this second. Longest

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
serving

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
president and she was probably the one that to the most

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
work in getting the fundraising committees to gather and

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.000
printing

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:23.000
our annual fundraisers and stuff like that.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Well

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
why funfest doesn't alas up

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
until

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
like something new that but it was kind of on a whole

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
different people and unity was. Well the.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
The founding father of our arrest was some finding Peter

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Altshuler

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
but. He moved out of the neighborhood after a couple of

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
years so I don't think he was aside from that year that was found

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in seventy eight he was in the leadership position after

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.000
the break.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Well I don't I'm not sure exactly when he left the neighborhood. I didn't

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
really know him but I think he was gone by the time writing terms. But

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
then the duty was president eighty one.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
See. He says and.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
He's sixty seven she's sick of it would

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
be kind of hard to know my wife was president of the

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
line to move forward

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
well almost the last five years and then our neighbor Barbara Baron

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
had been co-president with her for a couple

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
of years and I think she was the president had

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the final year before we merged with the Civic Council in two thousand and one.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Oh

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
yes we had a lot of community meetings on little sorts of

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
different issues in the neighborhood from

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
drugs and crime to transit to

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
we we also had events

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.000
like. The Droid centennial of the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
We

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
had we had talks on history the

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
area had a nice talk at

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the Prospect Park picnic us about

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
the one that was done for the environmental center. We had

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
a talk on the Battle of Brooklyn boy somebody had written

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
a book about.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Call

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
cards women would periodically give talks either on the history

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
or the architecture of the flu.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I think I was interested in a very

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
definitely not as knowledgeable about as some

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
people.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
We were also influential in getting the house tour extended

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
to something there. The slew of. First time

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
was

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000
seventeen rating. That they did.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Very rooted in there. I think I feel more room to huge here the well definitely where

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
we didn't know when

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
had I was fairly we need in my neighborhood when

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I was growing up as a kid but de Botton is aware of any

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
neighborhood organization. They're cheering when I was in the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Bronx.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Well

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
both are pretty liberal communities the area that I grew up in the

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Bronx had a stronger

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
relationship with some of the Union early

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
unions for the co-op thing in the neighborhood all our

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
lives right now my father was a doctor and he was kind of

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
the treated kind of like the community

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
doctor

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and pregnancy that I had a much stronger feeling

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
about community organizations. And involved when

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
they came through and also it's a very diverse neighborhood and.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
When we moved into

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
our house our most of our neighbors were probably Irish American.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
But there were some a lot of news in the neighborhood very very big.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Gain lesbian community. And I think it's a very

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
tolerant neighborhood and she's something I enjoy and it's.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Not willingly I can really can't imagine someplace all

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
cyclists comfortable to fans of New York Jets old.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Gibson

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
looking to coherent chronologically

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
here.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Well.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
There's always a lot of complaints about gentrification sneers than.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
It is an issue you. You do worry about where

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
people who'll have to leave because of hard. Rents are going to end

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000
up but I guess for for me it's worked out for a nicely.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
When we happen to live here at the time we thought the prices were very high

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
but knowledge

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
skyrocketed. But you're sometimes worried is it going to become

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
a neighborhood just of rich people are going to lose the diversity of.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Well things I find very encouraging is to see more

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and more young people move into the

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
neighborhood the same time fairly diverse backgrounds and.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So I guess there's still a lot of hope for the area.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And I haven't seen any decline in the neighborhood since I've lived here it's all

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
been pretty much on an upward trajectory.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So I have a lot of optimism. Thank you.
