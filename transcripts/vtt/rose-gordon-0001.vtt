00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
kidded me about the fact that they weren't and I was

And she had a done by but big was taking care of by a midwife.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And after the midwife left the the women and mothers on the block used to take

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
care for the patient. By cooking them food for the family. They just

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to come to the fire escape.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
To visit. And to give them anything they need it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that's how we lived we didn't know of any other way but helping each other.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we had.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We were poor and we didn't even realize we were

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
poor we had we let my brother and I always say we didn't even

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
know we were poor we had a good

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
time and then we had a grating. By the stores.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And it was a grating and it has had holes in it and used to find my

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
mother's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
mop. And put a piece of gum on the end of it and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
get the quarters. And dimes and nickels out of the year and of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
these on on the stick. I pray that it was back again if it didn't fall off

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you could run to the candy

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
store with your fries.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I don't

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
call her shoes was always popular and sometimes I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
get a so according to how much. Sometimes I get a pickle from the delicatessen.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
They had a stag pickle

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
barrel and.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And I say to my mother Can I have a nickel for a pickle.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And we had that was my.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Remembrance of my block but then we had Coney Island. And we

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
had the steeplechase I don't know if anyone spoke of the steeplechase. Where

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you would have a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
circular punch card. And then she would go on the ride they

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
would that was all rides kinds of rides in there. And you had to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
pay to go in and they had. The blow blow

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
up. Apparatus that when a woman lived in they used a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
whiskered small sleigh then.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Would blow up your skirt throughout

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
then and then you had your choice of. Rides I had something

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
called the iron horse in a slide and the boat ride. They

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
had just went around until you found something like. Had your

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
card punched. And went on the. And when on the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
ride it

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
was it was great fun.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
When we all look for the day we go there we had certain

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
places to stay on Coney Island beach.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Like as a teenager as you grew up and became a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
teenager teenagers would meet in a certain area on the beach.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That was like our of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
spot.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And. We never got into any trouble let the kids who are in today need

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to with swimming and. So always other into the water and on lap.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But the staple Chase was one of my

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
favorites

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and psychoanalysts a favorite of Brooklyn Dodgers was a favorite.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
That found at one point I husband and his brother found a hole in the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
fence of Ebbets Field.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And they used to cope with it for nothing. I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
used to sneak in. And watched era the beloved Dodgers who.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Who deserted

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
us. And I don't know do we have any questions for

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
me where you're

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
from they were born in Sicily and in Italy but the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
ball the ball of those two.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And. We went to an interest

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and instead trees dot com and we found out the town that we

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
were. That my parents came from.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And but we couldn't find much information so the girls

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
are thinking of taking a trip. My two daughters go I

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
can't really go anymore because like you I wanted to go.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But they wanted to see the

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
place. And. I went

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to P.S. ninety four here in

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Brooklyn. And went to bed I would try school in Brooklyn.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I didn't go any higher than that our whole idea at that time was to find

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
a guy and get married that was our

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
graduates.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And we used to write his name all over our book. And.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
A loose leaf book we used to write

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
on and. It wasn't a big thing with me

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I didn't. I was a tomboy. I was the Klein grooves and.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Play ring only Rio I don't know if anyone has heard of

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and you would say I declare war we had a circle with all

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
countries in it. And we would say I declare war on France. And that

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
person had to pick up

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the. Object and trying to get you the one that you declared that

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
declared boiler war on him.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So we have would stayed on the block and we had a very nice

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
time. And the girls always did composition.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Played composition songs like mining. My name

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
is Alice and I have a boy that had a start with an A anything it

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
had anything with an AI I eat. A lot of apples that will

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
be ten.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And that's it for me as a question to have. You know

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
what I did do after.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Oh after high school I'm going to.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I went to work in a bank on Fifth Avenue final one fifth

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Avenue across from the New York library.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
My husband was in the Korean War. But he was an

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
active in the war he was an M.P. stations in Germany.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And as they all said to me I was a young girl of course. Why don't you write to

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
this young man he's asking us to write to him. I said I can't be bothered

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
them to besiege you know having a good time yeah. So

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
they fell he came back and I met him in the

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
bank. And we are married when I read.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And they gave us a nice cry Don't shower.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We used to. Even the Automat around the corner way would put your money in.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This window. And food would be nearing you'd put the amount that

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
they asked for. And come out and have a piece of pie and a cup of

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
coffee. And then that's about it when we were married

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
then I had to leave the bank because I could mark in the same place.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
That he was.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But they always tease me about.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
He they always

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
tease me about not wanting to write to him and then end up marrying

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
him I was you can work in

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
saying what's

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the matter of security. That you know maybe you would ask me to do

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
something are they were says the purity

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
thing and. Yeah. So I went to a different branch

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
says Yeah. Your Hold on.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yes ma'am.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So what is it about.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Flava ball.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
If very nice place to live. Everyone used to take care of themselves

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
or any a lot of men were out of jobs years ago when the women used to.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And the women used to other families just to help them. Most of them worked in

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the Navy

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yard. Very when the ships coming

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
in and loaning them

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and. And their families husband women didn't work

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
of course they took care of the children. And if a family man was out

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
of work. Other women on the block used to say oh I

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
made extra beef stew do you and I and everybody

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
this isn't something that helps

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
them and help them get through the period when he didn't have

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
a job which I thought I think there's a fair test that things to do.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
They took care. Point another.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And then. That was just nice people I used to have to get a new

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
store on my block. Listen to wish chronic pain to store an attack.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And they were both made if you went to one. So

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
you say

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They used to sell the newspaper saw to the sidewalk where they would be tied up.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I used to clip them and they had a new stand outside

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
