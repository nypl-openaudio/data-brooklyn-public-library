00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is of Clark and here for the Brooklyn public library our streets our stories project I'm joined

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
by Brenda that Peters and today we're talking to Sheila GALLAGHER We're

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at the Dyker branch of the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
library and I kind of start a little bit further back than I normally do because it's just out of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so many wonderful photos. So tell us a little bit about your parents and where they came

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
from OK My dad was born in clue numerable County early

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
term little town or village cauldron Kiernan and my mom was born in so

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I go she was born in new cool in so I go

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
both all the terms and fly go or border counties they border each other but it wasn't

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
until many years later they met at a dance and Irish dance I guess in the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Bronx and that's how they ended up dating and getting together and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
eventually marrying and eventually having me and my sister and how did they decide

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to come over here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I believe in my father's case I think one of his brothers was already here. And his

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
sister was here in a sense to him because in Ireland at that time the economy wasn't

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so stable or you know and he was unable to get a job that he wanted and he felt

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
America would be a better choice for him that he would have more

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
opportunities and so he came out here and he worked into a number of odd jobs before he ended

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
up finally staying with the M.T.A. the transit

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
authority and he drove the bus here on seven day Avenue eight they have a new

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
line and he worked at a Jackie Gleason depot on thirty six Street which is that one of

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the depots for vocal and my mom I believe her sister a Melba

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the older one sent for her and she came out and she ended up working many years.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Seventeen years in

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
SRAM as a waitress and as a assistant manager and that was an

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
interesting job too

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because one of the story she told me was about meeting Mamie Eisenhower.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
She worked in traffic at the Chrysler Building and she also worked in the sheriff's in the White

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Plains area. So one day. Manny Eisenhower came

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in and requested tea. So my poor mother went and got a cup of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
tea and brought it to her table and put it in front of her and said here is you see and Mamie

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Eisenhower took one look at it and boy and said that is not

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
mighty Please go

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
back and get me my tea. So my mom brings back and one of the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
waiters called her over and he

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
said I'll take care of her. So they went to the bartender and they had a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
drink made up with a martini straight up and they put it in the teacup and brought it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
back to the table and she said oh now you brought me my

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
tea and that was

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
how she learned that Mamie Eisenhower had an

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
interesting so I'm going in addition to being the general's wife she was also

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
later on became first lady when she was you know when Dwight David

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Eisenhower became president but that's my mother's introduction to me

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Eisenhower and her cup of tea. And then you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
ventured a little bit about the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
as well as a story with that while the dance I guess was in the Bronx

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and at that time my dad had gone with an a lady named Peggy who Peggy

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
is lost in the annals of history but apparently Peggy followed my mother

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
into the ladies'

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
room and asked her for her phone number and my mother bought saying why would I give

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
you my phone number and she said it's for the guy outside Peter he wants to date

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you and my mother said well you're dating him why would I want to date him. But

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
anyway I guess

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
she threw caution to the wind gave the phone number and eventually they ended up dating and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
she realized my dad was a really nice guy and he ended up getting married and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
thankfully they did because I wouldn't be here otherwise.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You know they will survive and live a first there know they lived at thirteen

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
sixty Ogden Avenue in the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Bronx and. They had an apartment there and they lived there for a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
while and. Eventually they felt that they needed more space and they wanted to be closer to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
family especially my dad's side of the family I think my father had a long commute go to work with

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
transit because he was working out of Brooklyn he had traveled from the Bronx down to go to Brooklyn every

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
day so they contacted my Aunt May

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
who is a beautician and a iness one B.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
salons and she put them in an apartment on what they have in you and seventy seven

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
street but it was right over the boiler. So in the winter they love the apartment because they

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
had wonderful heat but in the summer it was like baking in an oven it was just too hot.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So eventually they ended up moving they found a place on what Hamilton

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Parkway and they moved in compliments of the Silverstone's who are very like nice

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
couple who would rent from my parents because you know a lot of times people don't want to rent

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to Irish Catholics hate to say it but they were not looked

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.000
upon

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
as good renters. You know but they got along wonderfully well with

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the Silverstone's they were wonderful couple and they treated my parents lovely and we lived in their

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you know their house or apartment I should say was over store and that's a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
very sad story too. Because the people downstairs they had the store at the time they were the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Rosen's and Harry rose and one night was leaving work of one hundred sixty two got

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
on the Belt Parkway. And was driving his car

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
home and the car stalled out in the rain and he had run out of gas on the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Belt Parkway which is a big no no he got out of the car and he went and got two dollars worth

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of gasoline came back with the gift tank over the the gas. Somebody call it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The little plastic refill gas thing. And as he was pouring the gas into the car

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
he was struck by another car and his subsequent subsequently killed.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So out of that tragedy. His wife was sitting Shivah

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
which I thought Tom I never knew as a little kid what Shivah was she sat on a box

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and she tore her clothing and she was mourning the loss of her husband my mom came

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.000
down to pay her.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Respects and out of that my mother eventual we worked with her and she bought

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the lease out and she opened up Gallagher's candy store at seventy one alive and for health

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
parkway. And they own a store for about eight years but they worked really hard they were up at four o'clock in

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the morning and they worked ten o'clock at night so it was long hours but it was very

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
profitable and together my father mother worked in the here and they really

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
did they really did a lot and it was interesting we had wonderful memories of the candy

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
store like. Well coming home from school I was never

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
hungry that's because when I would start off with a double dog and eat

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that and I had a ring ding and then of wash it down with the you home

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and after that it was a Milky Way bar and a Musketeer vodka and wash it down with a Coca-Cola.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So by the times in a rolled around you could say I was fully Tanger.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But they were happy memories there were good memories

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and we got to read the comic books and we got to look at the Bride magazines

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
so there were lots of things to do. And of course we helped my mom in the store we washed all the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
glasses the wash down the counters we filled up the candy for her and also took a

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
little for

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
ourselves and it was lots of things to go there was always something and I could wait on customers and that's how I learned

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
my subtraction or my addition had it in my head and how to subtract because we had a very old

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
cash register and it was unlike today where you put the numbers in and it does everything for you and it

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
prints the receipts and it tells you how much change. I was able to make change in my head and that helps me in

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
school

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
with my now my.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
What are some of your earliest memories of the

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
neighborhood the earliest memories of the neighborhood I guess were wonderful ones

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I remember going out on my bicycle I had a red bicycle given to me as a Christmas gift and we could

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
ride around the neighborhood and there was no such thing as cell phones.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You had Johnny's mother yell out the window and Johnny come home. Oh

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I'm no cell phone then the next neighbor would yell Johnny your mother wants

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
you and the next neighbor would be. So was like a telephone system but it was all mothers

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that were home or fathers that were home. Shawn a good older for if was agreed to

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
board. You know and then the kid with their own and then the kid would cycle home or roller

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
blade not roller blade he would roller skate home I'm sorry roller blades came much

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
later and. Everybody would play stupid all at night they would play.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Red Rover Red Rover come over they would play all different types of silly games but they were fun games and

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
they were active and everybody was

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
out you would sit on the stoop in the evening after you had finished your tours for the day

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and parents would watch the children play or play in the street it was safe. You could ride to

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
the park and go around the park on your bicycle and you didn't have to worry about being harmed or

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
anything because basically everybody knew each other it was the sense of good community

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.000
good

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
neighborhood and a happy time. It's a happy time. I mean I know today people have their

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
cell phones but they don't seem to interact with each other anymore they're always busy texting and looking

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
down and at least when we played we played with each other we would argue

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
with each other we've fight with each other but we're still friends the next day you

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
know. If you have a problem with someone go to the park you would settle it. And

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
you would shake hands at the end today. It's a whole different ball game people you

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
know are a little bit more prone to violence.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You know they don't settle their arguments with the handshake they settle it with a gun so there's a whole big different world

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
out there very different from when I grew up was much

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
nicer and you have memories. The classmates that I had back in

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that day when I graduated from any from today we're all on Facebook so at night

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you can tune in which your

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
classmates from forty one I don't even say the forty some odd years

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
ago and we did have a reunion after twenty years and out of the class of one hundred

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
sixty we had about one hundred twenty kids show up for the

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
reunion and then a few years ago we had another reunion after forty something years and it

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
was about sixty people or so that showed up for the reunion. So it was

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
nice. Well it's nice to keep in touch and it's nice to have that come right away that

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
sense of friendship. You have to so many years. You know and they're all over the summer in

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Massachusetts summer in

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Florida and yet every evening you can still touch base with them and that's one thing I like

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
about Facebook most technology I don't like. Facebook. That's OK.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You can easily. Yes I have a sister June. She's so blind. She's

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
very involved in art she has always been an artist since she went to Parsons College of Art and

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Design and she had put a studio apart on the top floor of her house

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
in Staten Island she subsequently sold a house in Staten Island.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
She sold her mother in law's house in Park Slope on fifth

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
street and they moved to Cape Cod Massachusetts and now she

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
has look at Gallery of Art going up there and currently she's working

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
on metal sculpture like a welding and different types of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
sculpture mostly her medium used to be like oil or

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
water

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
color. You know.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And where did you go for well if the Seine firms I went

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
totally Perpetual Help high school that was for years and

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
now all ph is shut down this was a girl's Catholic high school that's no longer in

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
service. And then from there I went to the four best years of my

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
life Brooklyn College I had a wonderful wonderful time a broken college and excellent.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I got to meet people from every walk every background of wife and I felt that was such a

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
great diversity there and I felt comfortable there. The people were very accepting

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
very far. I still have to keep in touch with my friends too from Brooklyn College.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So I've kept friends from high school college and from elementary school though I've

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
been blessed and then I went to graduate school at Brooklyn College also and.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
One of the things I did was take to see you and why did that thirty above they have to

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
my masters.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
When we went to England we were. To London North Polytechnic and we went to

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.000
view

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
students learning about science lab in England so Brooklyn College has a

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
lot of amazing things that they can do with with their students and they offer a lot

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
of courses and wonderful things I think people should take advantage of the cumi and the

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Sunni definitely

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because they are remarkable and you get a lot of bang for your buck I mean I think I went

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
through maybe two or three thousand dollars for undergraduate

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and for graduate school I think it was like maybe twenty five

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
hundred or something like

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that it was dirt cheap and it was the best education honest to God

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and I ended up using it because I went through college and

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
graduated with my Bachelor of

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Science and then I graduated my Master of

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Science and I became a special education teacher my background is

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
neuropsychological brain disfunctions working with children and have learning

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
disabilities and I've been teaching now for almost thirty eight years on thirty

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
six years at my current school which is McKinley I have to find knowing on seventy three zero

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
one what Houghton Parkway run by Janice Kerry an excellent principal served under fourteen principles so

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I know what I'm talking about but she's a lovely lady and wonderful

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
school. What. I

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.000
think

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
ironically. It can be said that the abuse that we suffered in the Catholic

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
school at a young age their grade in fourth grade was

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
hideous and I felt that no child should ever

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
be of use for a bully physically

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
mentally or emotionally and unfortunately that did happen in

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
my I would say second grade third grade fourth

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
grade and I felt that I could do a better job and I wanted to be a teacher so I can make

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
sure that the children under my care would learn and not be

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
abused and that's I know sounds terrible but that's the reality of

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
it. You know. What I've read in the

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.000
area regular

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
up. Well actually I started off I worked at P.S. one of two hundred

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
seventy second ridge Boulevard they gave me a place that was called T.M.R. which was trainability mentally

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
retarded in those days they don't use that word anymore. They say mentally challenge or

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
edge a complete

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
challenge. And I was working under Miss Mary Conners who is the principal

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
there and she said to me you know I want you to go back Sheila to Brooklyn College and I want to get

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
your master's in learning disability and become a resource on teacher and I said Huh. What's that.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And lo and behold I did exactly what she told me to do and then after

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that I had worked also in one of four to adopt a more school then

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
ninety second and fifth. I worked over at. One ninety two

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
on forty seventh Street in eighteenth they haven't you know I didn't like that school that was my first year

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
teaching to tell you a million stories about the kids in my class it was really

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
sad and eventually I after I graduated I went down to one hundred

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
attorney street and I met my professor from Brooklyn College. Her name is Elaine Thompson

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
she she took my thesis my master's thesis for me and she marked

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
it and I walked into the room and she said Sheila what do you don't hear I said that's a talk so what are you doing

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
here says I'm giving out jobs I said who will suffer a fine line. So we went to

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
a book and they opened the book and it was shuffling to the boat

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and she said where do you live and I said I live you know at that time I lived in my aunt's house on five

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
thirty five seventy fourth Street and I told her and she was all that's district what and I so it's

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
all district twenty I know and she let me see should not only have one school

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
in District twenty you don't want

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
it I said to what is it and she said you know wanted junior high school and

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
you know those junior high school kids forget about it you don't want them. No way.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So I said Well could you look it up and we pulled out the red book at that time there was a red handbook that had all the

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
school listed and she flipped through and she looked up the number and she says something called a will.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I said McKinley and she said yeah and I said she was Do you know what I said

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
oh yes I'll take it and don't I got my papers and went to

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
see my principal you design going to get her to you you're not staying on not

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
having your son to me I pick my own people you are not picked by

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
me I said Trust me you'll grow him of being I said don't worry that I'll work really hard.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'll be the best teacher ever. And I'm going to be watching your morning own and night I said

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
OK no problem watch me. All you want. Then I said you can put a webcam in the wrong i said i'm gonna be busy

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
working you can do whatever you

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
want long ball he danced my wedding.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Oh ho ho ho. So I need to say Mr Don Angelo I did say.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And needless to say I'm still there thirty six years later. OK

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So you know you can you know you can say I mean he couldn't kick me out I mean I worked

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
hard and he grew to like

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
me so Rajamouli So but yes he did like me in the end he danced with me at my wedding

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
so I think that's cool. It was a good man but very strict on my going into

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
very strict. But you could survive that you could survive anything you know I think all the principles

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that came behind him were like a piece of cake compared to him.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
What have been your biggest challenges is really biggest challenges. I

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
think I think the one

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
thing that I would have to say is the change in the discipline code.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I believe when I first started working was much stricter we had a very clear code

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
of discipline and children knew exactly what would happen to them if this

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
they did this the repercussion was this they did that the repercussion was that. But

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
today for whatever reason I think it has watered down quite a

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
bit and the teacher themselves even though we have two Deans of

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
discipline very nice ladies they work hard but I don't feel

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
the children can make that connection like. They they are. They are feeling that

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
there is no follow through or no repercussions if they go ahead and do something. That's wrong if they break

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.000
the

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
rules then you know they feel like it's more nebulous it's not

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
as clear cut as it was years ago. Like you know to lateness is equals one

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
cut two cuts equals one referral one referral means a trip to the dean.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Everything was very delineated today you can't even write a child up you have to

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
show fifty five ways that you have tried to contact and take care

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
of this child and coddle this child before you can put on paper anything that the child has done in

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
terms of misbehavior. And I think that's wrong. I really don't I am opposed to that I think

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.000
children

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
need to know that when you do this there are clear and concise consequences for

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
your actions right away. Don't wait ten months down the road and tell me this is your

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
now this is your

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
consequence because it doesn't there's no connection there you know and I think that's a problem. I

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
think discipline today is as a major problem because people don't want

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
to follow through on it or they tend to glide

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
over some of the things that the child doesn't the child feels oh I got away with this and this let me try this

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and it gets further down the road instead of nipping it in the bud the discipline is definitely

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.000
key

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
area and are there any moments in your career and particularly proud of.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Well I would say yes I have been very happy to work in the school and

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I've had some achievements along with certain students they have cheese quite a bit I had a girl a

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
few years ago who came in and was in like Dire

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Straits and she was having a lot of problems a lot of issues and

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
it turned out that her father came to see me and he was a lieutenant in the police force in

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Staten

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Island and. He he got custody of her he went to court applied for custody of

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
her he got custody of her and he said to me I've never had a girl and I've never had like eleven or

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
twelve year old girl before what do I do with

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
her so I went through a whole thing list with him you should do this and this and this and

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
this. And so on telling him about it and eventually she ended up.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Making our study our society she got eighty five and above in all her subject areas.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
She did really really well and she went on to a good high school in Staten Island and I was

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
very proud of how cheap MN You know she had come

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
in in a in a very sad fashion you know her mother was really unable to take care

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
of her and could working together with Dad we were able to get her up on her feet

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
and get her going in she was OUR a female and she loved all she loved

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
reading she was really a wonderful child she blossomed she really blossomed so she

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
was certainly a definite positive

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
factor in my career and with all the students along the way too that had emotional issues and things

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
like that and constantly pushing them along. I was able years later

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.000
to

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
sneak them and have them tell me you know hey you know I turned out pretty decent I did good

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and I remember you and I remember your class and I was happy to be a part of it.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So that's that I think in and of itself is a plus you know.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And there are many highlights. You know many children through the years that you service that you'll probably

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
never know about and hopefully all of them you will wish the best for all of

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
them and you try your hardest for all of them and many of them are successful many of them do turn out

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
to be good productive citizens and I think that's the blessing of being a

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
teacher. What is it about this

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
particular area neighborhood which you spent most of your life and that is unique.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
What is unique about Bay Ridge Well I think that I think that for

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
a long period of time when I was growing up

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
parents and grandparents still lived in this neighborhood and it was that home. Connection that even if you

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
travel far away. You could always come home to be a bridge and that was the beauty of

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
it and when you came home you felt like when you walked up or down the street you a bump

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
into neighbors and family members and friends that you hadn't seen in a

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
while and even though the years have passed. You still made that connection so I think that

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
that's one of the positives of a

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
bridge and. I think that they rich. Has been a wonderful community in so

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
many different ways I think they're very loving very giving I think during nine eleven

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
that showed itself very powerfully around here. I and know that we lost.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
One of our students. Eddie Graffanino he was a firefighter in nine eleven he went to

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Macon when he was one of our students he

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
died and we have a charity every year we give out awards. His father comes

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
to the school and gives out awards another firefighter that delight to see me from see

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
his students in the forms with Dennis So

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Burke and also to awards and things have been made in his name.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Of one of our Deans passed away some years ago her name is Dorothy Guerrero and she was a

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
phenomenal person I mean really loving calling and in caring and did a lot for

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
children and we have an award that's given out every year in memory of

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
her and also for many years we gave out in the word to George Rennes award he was a young

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
teacher non-school who died suddenly aged in this twenty seven or twenty

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
eight he had an asthma attack and he didn't have his asthma pump with him and he

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
pissed away on his way to the hospital but he was the band leader in our school and

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
he taught bands and he's a phenomenal young man and does an oil painting still

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
hanging in the school that shows you know his dedication to the

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
students and

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
to the the art of music you know and his name is George runs of

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
wonderful young men he died way before his time you know he's a very nice you know.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
But there's a lot of things that connect people and they range and a lot of things that are special

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
about people and a ridge and

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
certainly I love living here and I've lived here the bulk of my life and I hope to

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
go on doing so and a lot of my classmates feel the same way as I do my husband doesn't he wants

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
to go back to Connecticut where he's born and raised. But I still say Brooklyn

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
is the best you

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
know and I'm happy to be

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
or what are some of these changes. Oh

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
wow

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I would say probably stores mostly you know along what Hamilton

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Parkway stores have changed a lot eighty six street the same thing

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
to. Basically people dying moving away you know you

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
see that over the course of time you don't see as many of familiar faces as you

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
once did you know when you go

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
places you don't bump into people like you did at one time so things change

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and people do move away after their parents you know pass on sometimes they sell the house and

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
they move away. So you don't see as many of your colleagues and friends in Bay Ridge as you

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
once all of us to change and say.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And you tell us a little bit about going back to Ireland for the family

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
or what drove you to that.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Oh well you know it said I wish I had spoken

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
more to my mom and dad when they were alive but a lot of times people don't want to reveal their

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
personal feelings and things you

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
know but unfortunately father died when I was fifteen I did go back to

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Ireland when I was eighteen twenty one twenty two and I did go back to

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Ireland recently but my husband my husband had only been to Ireland once before when he was three years also

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
he really didn't remember Arlen very

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
much and now as an adult we went back in two thousand and twelve and it was wonderful to go

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
back you know to see the sights we went to Kerry. We went to the ring the Kerry.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
We went to Dingle

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Bay We travel to slow I go I got to see cool cold when my mother

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
was from we went to from Kiernan County

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Leach or my dad was from we went to St Brigid's church we saw

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
where my grandparents to bury that's interesting because my grandmother died like

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
all these twenty six one hundred fifty two and my grandfather her husband died August twenty

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
sixth one hundred fifty nine seven years apart the same

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
day and that happened was about my great grandparents. John. BARTON

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And Mira and Bridget

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Cullen they died within twenty four hours of each other and they were buried together on

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
the same day. One had died of a diabetic coma and then when she found

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
out her husband had died she said I can't live without him she had a massive heart attack she

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
died and they both were various again on the same day. So there is an interconnection I find

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
it dates a very interesting one of my great great grandmothers

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
was baptized

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
a hundred years to the day I was

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
born so I found that interesting you know. And so there is a

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
connection I always feel with dates like the seventeenth is a strong dating or family

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
my or my grandfather great grandfather died on February seventeenth. My sister had a son born

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
on February seventeenth. My father was born August seventeenth.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
My friend's mother passed away all of us and know her she

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
also was born on August seventeenth is like there's a lot of interesting things like the start line

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
and dates you see patterns repeat themselves

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
in family law I find that kind of interest my mother's obvious and. Oh you know one of a

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
great date and that was the one my friend Susan's my mother was born

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
then and I had my husband's seventeenth but his April seventeenth my mother was April seventh.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
So they liked each other he was God and God I said although there you see you know I'm a Gemini

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
my sister is a Gemini but we don't see eye to eye her with two

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
different two different people completely. I think we're about twenty three and very

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
tired always then find a hero listening to the office life of silence at the

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
moment

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
no I think I talk to deaf dumb and blind but I agree I appreciate the ability

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
to do this and I think it is wonderful and I'm very happy to be here or thank you. Thank you.
