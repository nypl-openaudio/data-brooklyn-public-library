00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So my name is Ben and today. November twenty first

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
two thousand and thirteen at the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Clinton hello for our street astore project oral history.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Where were you born.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Oh I was born in Cleveland Ohio.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Came to New York to go to college

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
in ninety nine hundred seventy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
two

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in Manhattan.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So it's not a real story.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Because it was more

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
considered to live and a lot of people it's hard to even get them to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
come visit us and so I had no plans

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to move to. And I knew nothing about Brooklyn and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I realized I was kind of blinkered. Back

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that it was maybe all

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I could really do to learn about Manhattan and New York City and I didn't know

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000
anything

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
about it and I thought it was kind of strange place where people

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
talked and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
then the other way it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
wasn't moved to Brooklyn for

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
really because it was where I could

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
afford to live and I don't know the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
really more affluent I couldn't

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
get that much and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I said I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
never. I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.000
moved to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Brooklyn.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
don't and I write. A

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
lot and.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That was really.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That kind of lived up to the refutation of a very

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
dangerous neighborhood that day. And the person is not really

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.000
funny

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but I I signed the agreement with

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the artist to snark to lies and she

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
was very kind of hard headed together person who knew how to manage

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
her career and I didn't find till after I had signed that the reason she

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
was moving out blitz because her husband her boyfriend had

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
been seriously injured by kind of muggers or something outside

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
their outside the subway station and so they had hit him over the head with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it to life and he almost died

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
so that was that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
not that you know not that surprising given

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that this woman

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
was something of a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
smoothie to it it's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
maybe she didn't let that slip until she

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
had lived in Dumbo. But it was kind

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of really it was the two big projects.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm not sure that their houses are in and was very much.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
A feeling like those people have been here kind of don't. You know to get them

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
out of the way. Now closer to song like super duper super

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
do very very sad neighborhood that you in

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
even to recognize it's a beautiful name and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that wealthy neighborhood.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You know. I did. Sure there's a lot of beautiful people in the fire and expect them but I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
only experience kind of the scary people. So

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
anyway

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
had to move out of there because she

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
actually decided to come back to the. Well.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
by that time I had a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
boyfriend

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and we ended

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
up finding a place we could afford here in Clayton.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And it was one bedroom for you in a brown stone for eight hundred

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
dollars a month.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So that was the first of a happy home in Brooklyn. So that

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
was my name when I first got here.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Year that

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
was

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
eighty. Something

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Heidi. And you know

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
quite a few years ago.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Compared to my sister in Park Slope.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It was actually more friendly. Here we found it was just it was a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
family near here and beautiful in the spring there had to find.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The beautiful Victorian town. So I I'd like to film

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
the beginning even though it was it was also kind of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
rough and able to back down off of the fear and they were

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
like you know more like people burning.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It garbage cans they burn stuff to keep warm and a cold night like street dogs kind

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
of

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
wondered.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But it was still a lot of middle class. And I kind of

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
met them. They were family so that was really

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
nice

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and. We got married. It

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
was lead to a happy happy ending for me I might

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
say because it's not always going right.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And we started a family and we moved to

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
a two bedroom condo wanted to have dad. And parking the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
car and

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
avenues

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and. The

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
leap in there.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And that was the housing preservation and development concept it was they had advice like

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that middle class condos and I think they

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
did successfully stabilize middle class neighborhood because.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
There was a sense that there's been a couple subsequent real estate crashes.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But the neighborhood continues

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
to stay on how it's almost destabilized in the

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
other direction that it's going crazy that hi hi it's kind of

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
the same.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But when we moved in we

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
had we I was pregnant when we moved in

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.000
very

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
quick and I couldn't

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
even I couldn't

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
even be there because I was hospitalized with gestational

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
diabetes when we were planning when we would the day came to move.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And so my husband had to do it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
With the help of some men with him

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
then

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
it was. It was just it was a lot it was just so bad I don't even know how.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Right now.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Well. By now

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
we my husband had a good job and I became a stay at home

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
mom for seven years the type really

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
to. This Great say. I know there's many different ways it's not

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
good for everybody.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And I have some friends in the kind of little children and it was

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
just some visiting back and forth every day

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and and going to the playground and

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
seeing people

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and those who are you know

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the happy years and the irony

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
is

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that we would be like sitting on ice to kind

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
of well neighborhood in some kind of crack crack I say back before my SO I

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but it was still we were like you know like they're well you know we're like really high

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
functioning people on the you know that. And then began to come home with

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
their suits on in the little kids would come to

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
me. And the moms who would you know go inside and make dinner or

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
something and that and we were kind of like you know our cars were not getting raises that

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
we weren't. Having all these justices. Some of the lower income people are

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
having and now the back I know you know our value is gone up

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
maybe five times that Lee. But the other people I know the more affluent

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
people and we've had we are struggling more economically.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We've got a decrease in our economic be kind of going up and down but at least.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It's just enough. We had stability to have child

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
raising years. So that's good.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But it is emblematic the middle class is having a harder time people get people

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
get downsized allowed the corporations

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
don't want to.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Have loyalty to

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
their way out there and. So

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that's kind of nice. And now.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
These web developers I don't even know what the well off people are maybe people with family

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
money live in the name of right now. You do see kind of

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
eerie people who seem very carefree like they can just buy whatever they want you

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
know walking around. They have cute little kids you

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
know so that they have nannies

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and oversized C.N.N. is pushing expensive you

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
know sensitive strollers down the

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
street

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
you know a cute little kid.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So that's kind of

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the in a nutshell kind of the story of me

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
being so clean and Clinton you know but I made I did make friends and

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I do feel

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
like. Sometimes I think we should all

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
cash out you know and move someplace we can really afford to get financial stability but I would

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
hate to. You know where would I live

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
with connections

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and friends my community garden my church you know.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I don't know actually green acres and Franklin green.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Yes I know the one that people

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
like that's where that's that's the not

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the end of the story the most recent

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
cap that

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
well yeah I do have some very

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
nice memories of this library.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That's you

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
now. Coventry jazz concert here.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
In just a

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
commune all proud jazz guys and there's an audience of

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
maybe maybe you know maybe twelve people with the kids and.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I was proud of my kids because they could see you know

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I pay attention and the jazz guys was very cool Cassidy was just.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You know it takes a trained really mentally

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
challenged really really free concert in your local

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
library and then another fun memory was coming

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
here because my oldest was very good at our

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
county and even had a young age to make me sick

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
so far so down and he could sell some of

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
these little bit more complicated

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and or Downey sessions so we could not miss that.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So we found out.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
You know are both still to really call it we made it here to this

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
very cold weather. You know at the dark and we can do

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
it golden you know warm weight and origami ladies sitting

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
there and she had

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
come from her sick bed and who worries was she could hardly come up with

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
she really wanted to do this or the session. She took our

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
nominee very seriously just kind of. Make no sense

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
of humor but she was great for

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
her

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and when I came in I saw there was an age limit because maybe

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
they didn't have little kids they just couldn't do it and my my kid was under the age limit.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
But she could do that she could do those butterflies extensions. So

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
guess.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
What I'll make up.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
think

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
we made friends. And I will do retired she says.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
She didn't want to do

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and she. She.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But also the community I got very involved in the community garden for the last fifteen

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
years.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
That's

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
my

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
stuff that sparked my interest because I

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
had planned on my condo I think

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
most of the Korean community at the condo. And the

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
employees suddenly employ the professional

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
landscape and they read everything they

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
had to move. Some of my plans and we directed it and I saw

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
this new garden opening up and I just that was myself you know it's a

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
home for my industry. I was

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
very open and then we appreciate it which a lot

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
of places you know it's like I don't know about you or your book.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
But little by little.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You have been started by locals over the locals but

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
also the environmentalist group

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
called up by and high school.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I was an environmentalist.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Before and.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I had a lot to sort of McCain choose to come

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to although I don't buy school but he came to come to councils.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
using you know in renewable energy and.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And you know

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
it was actually I think it was started in two thousand.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Because it was shortly before nine eleven.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And it was got some context. The real estate

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
of the building next door. They basically couldn't sell it at almost

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
any price. And

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
now. With only a couple of million

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
don't

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
think Canada did something

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
during the.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Divil

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
that it's a good question because he always he drives a

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
car coke to do like

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
shopping.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I know one hand I do try to patronize some of the locals. But there are a lot of

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
things that didn't make you couldn't you know like good.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Really. Well it baby store. You know I had to go

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
to other neighborhoods to do a lot of

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
shopping but I had actually lose for you

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
know before I. And I found out it seems like great

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
to live in a futile upscale neighborhood. But oh over

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
time it's depressing if you can consciously Pastore the restaurant that you can afford to go

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
to so in some ways going to the local little mom and pop stores

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and buying penny candy that was all the shopping and that was a lot you

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
know I was in my price range.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
was really happy or if I happen to get a really good

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
deal in the new and expensive neighborhood I think over

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
time I would be right. Just behind penny candy

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
and and a few sheets

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
in their last few months

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
now too and I mean the little bit at the end of the first

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
book in the eighty's and if you are going to fight the

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
wars that actually went out

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
of the kind of decide to it now.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And you know

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
was actually really the sky kind

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
of kind of junk

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
store guy because he probably you

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
know that kind of seems like there was like a muffin story kind

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
of like coffee and muffin. This is like a gentrified

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
type of an idea and I like that little store.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
But it couldn't quite hang on extremists and

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
now. You know

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
at the store he expresses you

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
know everything everywhere

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
down. The flame working to

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
the

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
yeah oh yeah that was. But there

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
was this is there for like maybe ten years at the mountain and

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I know that

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
because you know back in the eighty's.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
You know we couldn't even believe it was honey bee couldn't even believe we were thinking

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
like that so they're very helpful to try and bring a good and

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
upscale classic Italian I child to our club that there is and it's still there.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And we've got the same thing

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
about down there kind of

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
like I'm not saying not to do it was OK now I cannot

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
believe that playing out is money into making the call nice it's good to have

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
like five months and still are two people tapping away

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
on Apple computers.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Now anything that opens up it wouldn't surprise

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
me not to remind my kids

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
that it wasn't that I don't I got my Africa

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
that's pretty crazy.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
What any of the parks

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
you

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
would go to

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
the week of the green

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
color me to

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
see it's

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:13.000
not the last. Yeah.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Just you know

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
the police you know and.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
That's the red type which is the little.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Shoe it is that we consider that like too dangerous to

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
get and for some reason this is the case and

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
gentrified just before.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
You see

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
my guide to get an internship for a year or two. That's what a green park with the

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
from the conservancy and so I got

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
lucky.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
That.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Yes that's.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
We did i could drive to the park in part of their ninety's

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
taking it

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
to school

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
actually. I managed to get them

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
to a private school. And they went until eighth

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
grade and then they went to Brooklyn just for a year and

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
yeah. Yeah I

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
see I see the schools. Hopefully they're improving

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
out here because I think they used to be

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
pretty you know I

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
actually took my own this mine too. So I don't even remember

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
the name I wanted to pre-K..

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.000
A local

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
school

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
and

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
you know bad guy and it was like ninety two but they literally had

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
to call the police at

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
that like craft session. Her parents. Fight broke

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
out you know it was I mean it was really painful

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
and we're fighting for people that cared about that.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And yet you know. So

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I found for some reason the parents around they had like a book that was a magazine about handguns

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.000
and

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
think

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
this really is a librarian facing all people I guns let me get a magazine about hand. And have a

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
good deal it is just me says James I consider like confiscating

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
you know. The way they gave

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
the

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
school was not a good school. They did have like twenty three percent

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
a grade level. Do better next year.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
I think you know that we see the kind said there was more that was kind of

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
a

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
town character kind of feeling to go

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
really kind of stayed for

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Social it up hopefully

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
more

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
educational emphasis would be better.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I guess. Did you learn from this time in life

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
you know.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yeah

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
he did learn a lot

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
about the value of being in one place takes a

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
long time to really understand there

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
were doubts about people

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
and to sions and the

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
environment

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
and

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
you know I was the general liberal but I didn't really understand everything

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
that was going to

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
to

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
really you know step by step getting to

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
know what

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
you're good you know outside you know good. Besides

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
just kind of being

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
like she

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
couldn't

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
live in that live or something that was actually getting to

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
know that I think

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
and this

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
is if you have to go out there.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And that is a very valuable. I think you feel that. You know. And

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I felt

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
like. I got me to

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
come in you know

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
like you can feel like oh I have it. I have a great here but I can't really very

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
much because I don't know all

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
these really scary good. So if you we're If you

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
feel a little better obviously you could

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
say to the country.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Well mainly black Americans who

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
is going

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
to really you

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
know I don't even know

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
that so much that we could be people who can make

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
and stuff like that so that was fun for me

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
to hear.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And also like to usual church going

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
to church but not.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Not

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
going to like

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
it that you didn't like the people

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
here

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
