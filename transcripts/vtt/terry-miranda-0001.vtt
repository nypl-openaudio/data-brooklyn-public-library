00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
sixteen where you boys.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I was born

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
at Methodist Hospital which was then Presbyterian Hospital

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
on six Street seventh Avenue in

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Brooklyn and.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I think I moved as a infant with my parents to Connecticut because they have

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a family father had brothers and then I was there about four or five years and came back to Brooklyn.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And lived with grandma and then Mary when my parents

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
split. On sixty eighth Street. He went to say

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.000
needs from

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
school

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and been. In this neighborhood

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in and environs pretty much all my

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
life off and on a few years here and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
there and which neighborhood did you spend your. YOUNG

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
CHILD My young childhood was striker which was like but Eighth

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Avenue the area Eighth Avenue for Hamilton Parkway.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And that's so neat from school and I guess it's considered indictor also

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so that's where I spent.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
My grammar school years went to school and had a business

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
school graduate as a

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
secretary worked in the city. Most of my life sometimes in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Brooklyn and segues into being a legal

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
secretary. So a lot of a lot of years were spent in

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
field and where your parents or my parents were from the Middle East.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
My mother was from Damascus

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Syria and my father was from the more Lebanon and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
they're both Christian Christian Middle Easterners and they immigrated

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
here probably. In the nineteen teens in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the one nine hundred seventeen nineteen eighteen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Something like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that when there was there was I think during the First World War around that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
time and did they have other family here.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The whole families came with them. Yes my father's family was intact my mother and father

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
were alive.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
My mother's family yes. My grandfather

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
came first and then calls for the fam the rest of the family they each had

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
seven brothers and sisters my from other side of my side.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So they're fairly large families on my mother's side. Several

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
of them died in their fifty's sixty's.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I think one of my aunts old in Brazil.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
From Syria. One of her sisters. So I've made contact with all that family too

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
over the years we've

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
been in contact so it's it's nice.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I had thirty two first cousins at one point my life.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So it's been what are some of your earliest childhood memories.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well I remember

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that as children we played on the block. So we had a lot

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of friends mostly school chums we all walked to school together and came

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
back together.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And my my grandmother's landlady was no we Jim so they weren't Catholic but they

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
were Christians. So they didn't go to the same church but they had her daughter lived

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
upstairs and she had three children and we were all friends you know we'd hang out or go to each

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
other's birthday parties. And where I live there was a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
back area where all the garages were and they had little gardens. So we would play

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in the backyard a lot and have the hose out in the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
summer by the garages were

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
always after hours and. Playing stick ball and still

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
ball and whatever the games. You know games kids played at

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that time. And there's always the parents of two out to watch over us. You

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
know. I have very pleasant memories.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I got my first bike when I was about

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
seven. And a bunch of us had bicycles and roller skates and one time

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
with old bike to Coney Island Believe it or not as youngsters.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I don't know how we made it. And

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
it was really it was really close knit and fun.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Depression and Trammel off and on because parents

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
split but my dad was in and out of in and out of my life for a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
while. For most of my life and he remarried and stayed in Connecticut after when

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I was about twelve thirteen. But mom worked as a

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
seamstress as did most of the family on my mother's and my father's side to their role

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000

you know gorgeous I mean really good stuff. So we all learned how to sew a little

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
bit. It's not

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
tremendous as opposed to the children they can sew.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000

something good ice do my homework do a lot to.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Once we moved out of my grandma's house

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and. You know to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
trolleys and I remember one neighbor two doors

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
down from the Italian family her grandfather owned a plot of land on

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
about and he is to make wine.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It was like you know it was really it was

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
really a stable childhood for me despite

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the personal problems. I mean everyone was there for each

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
other you know and I used to hear.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
My aunt everyone used to hear my aunt screaming for the Brooklyn Dodgers when the Summer

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
T.V. We didn't have T.V. then until I was

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
about twelve or thirteen I got my first

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
T.V. so very different

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
lifestyle but my aunt got a car and how my mom had a

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
car in single working women who were able to manage.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000

Have you spent most of your adult

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000

French speaking

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
French

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
country at that time and what about this neighborhood.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Is unique.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
What I enjoy and what I like is the diversity of

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
architecture and a variety of of supermarkets and

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
stores and foods that are

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
offered and now with the influx of the aura of the

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Asian market Oh my God. I mean just fabulous stuff you

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
know and we have our own Brooklyn

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Chinatown in the in the sixty's down all the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
way. Which is growing by leaps and

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
bounds. And I enjoy that you know I enjoy

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
different cultures learning about different cultures being on a block that

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
has variety of people who live there Muslims Next Door Tarion.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We used to have no

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
wages. You

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
know variety of

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
people that live that live on one block is amazing.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And that's what I enjoy as well and it's very safe for children as far as I can

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
see them very few incidents

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
of abductions or attempted abductions or any kind of

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
violent crime.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It's really at a

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
minimum and if you read the police report it seems to be a lot

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
but it's never affected

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
us you know I mean I leave my door open all day

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
long and never had an incident. No one on the block as far as I know.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So you have some than dualism with cars and

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
things like

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that cation

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
cops some drug drug stuff going

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
on goes on everywhere.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
For

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
sure why are you part of that I can see
