This

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is Anna Clark for the Brooklyn public library on our street our stories project. I'm

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
here with some for you. It is May eighth two thousand and thirteen

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we're going to talk about his life and experiences in the neighborhood of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Williamsburg So I guess we should just start off with where were you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
born born in Williamsburg actually first house I've lived in

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was on twenty fourth through about when you then four shortly

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
thereafter I moved to I didn't move my parents moved me

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
actually to three thirty on Bedford Avenue where I spent most of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
my growing up years went to school at St Peter's and Paul which is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a very straight and high school in Manhattan and power memorial.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But generally lived there until my parents moved back to Puerto Rico

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in one thousand nine hundred ninety two.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
As

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
best probably since about nineteen

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
forty something probably latter part of the big move

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
from two twenty four three thousand you probably came from the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
edge of Bed Stuy. With the streets

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
around that opportunity

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
opportunity and a kind of slavery and he

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
said yes they are the first they came by

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
boat probably in the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
late twenty's maybe early thirty's I would I would suspect the probably be the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
late twenty's. Landed on Columbia Street which is now in the Red Hook section

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
very interesting place. I think it was a tiger and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the Odyssey but with the two boats that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
might that it come together they met here but there was the two ships that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
were applying the waters between Puerto Rico and New York at the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
time to have any

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
particular early childhood memories.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Have lot to tell you that a lot. Well I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
think

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the Williams Very good to me growing up was

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
very familial very family

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
oriented place. We had a lot of kids I went to Catholic High grammar school

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which couple blocks away so my

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
life really revolved around a three or four block area.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
My friends playing basketball going to school with.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Even throughout high school we kept in touch and as we all scattered to different

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
schools some private schools like PA memorial St Francis Prep

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
or something along those lines or public schools like

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Westinghouse my father was a lead a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I want to buy they go as we call them he had a little store

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
on south a street between Bedford and Berry. And.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You know that played a big life part of my life tallying between Southard se

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
brink bringing him his

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
dinner working in the store and Saturdays helping

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
him you know moving goods or delivering food we used

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to at that time used to deliver groceries of theirs to the six story

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
walkup It's like the Fresh Direct back in the scene at fifty five you

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
know. It. You know just just living in a neighborhood it was.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
At that time was somewhat mixed more mixed and it wasn't as I got older.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
There was still a healthy representation of Jews

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Polish

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Irish so and. During my time in my early

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
years when I took you know five eight nine ten years

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
old then as I got a little

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
older those folks started moving in.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And they were you know the parents are getting older. The kids are starting to move out that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
it became really a bad Hispanic

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
community predominantly Puerto

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Rican some blacks not many that would

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
have been other other parts of the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
neighborhood in the sixty's a lot of gangs predominantly

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the young not the Lord and the help burn as those are two two big

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
things that operate in the community and it. It was you know zip

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
guns and you know gang fights very sort of West Side Story

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
which is very clannish we never

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
walked into the left side of the snow side. Very town

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and in between there was one

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
school that closed pretty early but it was a small Polish community.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You know in fact one of the guys used to hang out with us and his teddy type you know.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In that block which was very that was right across from the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
church south of second between Barry and white the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
very solid

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Polish community or block and you know as time went on that that sort

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
of disappeared as well. My

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
mom was a homemaker for many years but then she got a job working for the Board of

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Education as a cook she was the head cook for a school

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in I think was that Diane St Mark's when

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
you say Mark's Place right and the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
children's music. So she's do

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that here

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in the building

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
where my father had his store had

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
huge huge coal boilers coal called Fire boilers

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and what we used to do was take the potatoes

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
from my father's potato den and then go into during the wintertime

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
going into the boiler room putting. The potatoes on a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
stick and cooking them over a cup of the cold hard

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
calls these are big boilers sevens like you know those of like

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
a lot of the things we used to do was and obviously it

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
was you know. It was just the people that were there these to come in every day and

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
sometimes they standing on the counter and help my dad you know make me feel like I was a

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
businessman and you know and being with my father was a lot of and

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
so when it was

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
about basketball and baseball

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and basketball and baseball really you know city sports.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
My my daughter who who was working for a

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
an advertising firm in Portland

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the firm handled the Nike account.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And they also handled the converse nigger's

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
account of that and this is

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
really so I got a pair of Converse knickers from my

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
daughter the other day and I put them on for the first time in like forty

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
years and I cannot believe how hard

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
they were.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Saying this because wouldn't growing up we used to buy our converse knickers

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
on the corner of roving and have them are this Army Navy store twelve

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
dollars for irregulars the used to burn into the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
bottom are and it could've been that the little line was crooked so they put him as a regular by

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
them and I spent my entire day playing basketball in

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the sneakers and I put him on forty years late and I could walk and then

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
they did so hard so we you know we spent a lot of time playing basketball.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I happen to had some skills have some skills and in swimming so I sort

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of branched out a

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
little. So I did I went to the neighborhood Y. over there

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
because my parents. They were probably lower middle

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
class a little bit more disposable income and that's where used to go after

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
school. And I learned how to swim there. I got my license to be

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
a lifeguard and that helped me become a lifeguard in Coney Island so I

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
were the beach for a number of years as a lifeguard this great of the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.000
same cast

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
of twenty nine inch

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
waist is wonderful how do you describe

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
your neighborhood.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Well you know growing up in in

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the segments let's call it from birth to

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
about fifteen sixteen. It

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
was not a very bad place to live and it was pretty

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
cool you know we know everybody a lot of the people who are around there you know we were tight groups of

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
friends and we played basketball as

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
a side and baseball we did sports and whatever we can get our hands on

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
later on as the neighborhood began to change dramatically.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It is war

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
as we became for socially conscious.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And seeing you know a little bit more poverty in the neighborhood a little more

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
crime drugs then it became a very very different neighborhood when I

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
was growing up because I could have been just totally not aware of it.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
You know being younger and as I got older. I just became more and more aware of it but the

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
gangs in the early years weren't into drugs as much as they were in the sixty's with

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
heroin started pouring into the communities and stuff like that started claiming a lot of lives.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So we the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
group that I hung out with the most we we were

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
very much attached to the church. Big big influence

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
in our lives Catholic Charities which is a. Organization in Brooklyn had put

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.000
in a lot

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
of time and energy and money into afterschool centers

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and in social workers to work with the kids group work and stuff like

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that and they did it in three different predominantly three

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
different churches

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
epiphany chance figuration and Peter in part

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
so the Association for a lot of us was what church which is

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
what your parish and even boards when you start going to different label Jesus

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
identify it have been Reggie's to call St Anselm C.S.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
because ph and stuff like that but we did a lot of

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
stuff when spared. Around social clubs. So we are

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
you know so we sort of tend to

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
self identify with groups and his cause sells Christian names like the deacons of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
testimony and. The Christians and stuff like

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that and we. And it's by age group so the Christian to a folder or

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
universe along is a little younger I belong to the deacons stuff like that

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and they were it was very

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
much friendly with very different communities like through

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the church you know through penny always parent with us that was

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
totally different community. And you know we did a lot of sports together we

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
played softball against them and we check neighbor

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
championships and the thing is that the

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
church saved a lot of folks. Through these

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.000
programs

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
lost a lot but we saved them on

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and it was a time that a lot of the priest and the nuns were into

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
social change and social activism and a lot of us got involved

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
in in doing. You know community work in many many different

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
forms later on I got involved in housing movement in students.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I started as the deputy director then became director and a lot of us

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
still keep together. I mean you know I'm still friendly little lot of the some of the

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
guys and gals that I grew up with you know since first grade in grammar school. So you know it's

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
very very very

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
tight to

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
find

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
my cultural or just particular family

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
where

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
my

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I came from a very My parents came from very large

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
humungous family. I was doing sort of like a

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
to search the other day on

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the fact my father's family's.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Web page and I never really counted it but my father had eighteen brothers

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
sisters. And my mother's side we had from

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the second wife. Fifteen brothers and sisters and I'm

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
not quite sure how many from the first wife but I'm sure it

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
was in double digits. So I have about one hundred first

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
cousins at least at least.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
But the ones that I really knew were the ones on my mother's side and a lot

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
of them came all the while they were like fourteen. You

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
know the most intimate twelve girls and three men on my

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
mother's side a good many of the women came none of the men

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
came to and I still haven't figured that one out. But.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
we had about at some point maybe eight or ten of my mother's

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
sisters all around Williamsburg and and also

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
in Bed Stuy in Brownsville and places like that and moved on

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to Bushwick and. All the places which are really have now called the

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and it

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.000
was

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
a really really really close family so the traditions for the traditions of

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Easter traditions of getting together to New Year's Christmas and you

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
know tradition of just dropping in and on and on your cousins

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and your aunts and uncles houses and stuff like

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that my mother because my father worked a lot of hours at the

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
store and my mother worked you know five days during the week she liked to go

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
out love to go out

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and most times somebody the store the other day

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and it's almost like a tradition for her anyway and my

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
family my mother would say let's go to visit somebody like my

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
D.D. globally and she lived in grapes and back

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
then and my father said call first to see if she's

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
home and my mother would say

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
no because if she wasn't home they wouldn't go anywhere. So my

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
mother would say let's get in the car. Let's take the ride and we'll knock on the door.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And she said if they're not home. We had a nice run. But that's the way

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
it was

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I mean the thing is it's a tradition in Puerto Rico's I don't know if it's still but even you know

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
last time I was there you just sort of like show up and all of a sudden you're

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Fadden you're you know you visit another family just show up and

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
that's the way it was over here in New York and it's not you know this is still just a nice

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
little way you lived the way you were you treated with you know

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
by family and the openness and there's a tradition that you know you just did

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
it

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
so

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
my mother was was a little bit eclectic in her cooking she was

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
an incredible cup. I mean she had all the. All the Puerto Rican Staples she did

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
very well but she branched out a lot you know and I don't mean that she was like

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
a you know I'm a cook or anything like

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
that but even to go into the Italian food or eat you know she'd things like that that was

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
different from a lot of other folks in the neighborhood would have cooked and not a

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
little departure from Puerto Rican cooking. So you know I was introduced to different types of food

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
but Puerto Rican food that was that was a specialty especially in

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
she when she

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
was working at the school as a cook.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
It just so happened that one of the dieticians

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
for that area happened to be my mother's niece.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So what they would do was they would

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
experiment cooking for an

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
entire grammar

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
school using you know ethnic foods with they had no you know they

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
had no real recipes. They didn't say like two teaspoons or you know what I mean

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
it's so cute imagine cooking for six seven hundred kids and creating

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
these recipes for those you know for the food and stuff

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
like that she was good because of that but she never

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
taught me how to cook. You

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
know it's one of those cooks that said yes that's how much he put it he's

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
he's a little one to dealing you know which means just a little bit you know.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
What just collect that throw it in. And you know never say qualities to have these

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
from tables and just do it and you know and

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
if she had what we call it a lot you did a lot of putting families will tell you that they have the magic pot.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
They have this one pot on the stove that they can have ten people show

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
up and out of that one pot create a dinner for for

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
ten people. It was just you know like the miracle of the. And fishes you know fish in

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
those it was

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
just

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
incredible

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
to me about everything that.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Well it started quite frankly again with the church. I mean the thing you

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
said one of the things that we used to

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
do during Thanksgiving was there was a lot

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
of food donated and turkeys and you

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
know can foods and stuff like that we used to

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
do as a group my

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
friends through the church. We used to deliver

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
those food to a lot of the

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
the family support families in the community. Given

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
my vast experience of walking up six flights for my father you know stores delivering food has

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
pretty good at it.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
But then you know the sixty's came around and it was you know the you know

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
more and it was it was you know the fight to

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
do elections and get people that we

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
had we you know we met friends and folks from different parts of

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Leesburg that were working towards changing the elected officials and stuff

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
like that so he started getting involved like

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
that

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
we worked on the first second Lindsay campaign campaign to

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
oust Gerard Rooney who was you know very

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
very conservative legislator there. We worked on the our

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
lives teen It was a really I'm a very progressive guy

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
who was running for Congress Delany's campaign so we just you know we sort

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
of organizing you know a political campaign to

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
working with campaigns and as you go through that you start all of a sudden beginning

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
more aware of some of the major problems of the neighborhood you know housing being one of them.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
The bigger one who is a time to have. People were really beginning to walk away

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
from landlords walking away from their their responsibilities in housing.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And you had developers are coming into being what they call

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
got rehabilitation of buildings displacing you know all of the tenants and those tenants will

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.000
never come

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
back so you know stuff that you were doing organizing politically was

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
being broken down by those types of actions and those type of things

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
there was no voice in the community in terms of programs and elected

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
officials and stuff like that so all of a sudden you know people started getting

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
involved

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
and once again you know getting involved in you know when you look lose

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
the predecessor to live service with this group called New Age

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
realty bunch of idealistic guys and gals who felt that you

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
know if you were diligent. You could run

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
housing and through the red rose you can manage it and get it done.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
They they would quickly dissolution and they found the the the red world did not have enough money in it

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
to buy the oil to make the

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
repairs and they started experiencing some of the issues that a lot of the lenses

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
were experience in the community and they then turned around and

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.000
through the

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
city programs began another group

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
called lawsuit S.. And they organized it was really to because the guys who

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
were involved were

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
from you know the thing guys from Chance figuration the same guys

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
from Peter and Paul saying guys from the fifty's that we all know.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
The chance guys as we call them they had a very couple of very very

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
activist priest there you know Brian Cabell is I don't know people heard his name is John Mulhern. You

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
know these guys were like.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Incredible. They were much more politically active that we

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
were in some of them a little bit older but their

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
influence in our relationship. Sort of brought us along seeing work together

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
the stuff.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:13.000
So

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
your work

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
need

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
a moment here that you are hearing

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
that the proudest

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
moments the proudest moments just to see

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
and help and save a couple of buildings in doing ten organizing

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
you know I did I also did all the maintenance part of it as a supervisor a lot of the

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
operational rent collections and stuff like

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
that some policy work mainly but mainly running the business from that

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.000
point to

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
be working with

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
these buildings stabilizing them and

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
building but and maintaining a community and that

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
was like incredible to have that type of influence

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
and you know using the programs in

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
the city for the best and for the benefit of a lot of folks who are who

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
were called personally because

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
people you know guy got on the board of this was

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
was his name was done for none dough. He lives on sub second Street to twenty five

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
to two to twenty so it's first

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
rate and he he worked as

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
a assembler Fedders air conditioning.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You know and all of a sudden you know he probably had if maybe an eighth grade education. Well

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
the Son The sitting on the board of the organization

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and running a company. I mean it's

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000
it's developing you know real leadership within the community.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Running

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
a corporate and bringing people along.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
It's a it's a real education process going into the

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
building and talking to folks and trying to have them get to get organized in order

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
to control their living space in the

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
building working together to to a common goal. It takes a lot of time and

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
a lot of trust a lot of energy and people have different motives and you know not

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
everybody is you know people

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
sometimes leave me alone I just want to get up in the morning go to

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
work come home turn on T.V. and watch a baseball game.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And you know sometimes you've got to get everybody involved in sort of

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
stuff and it's that that's really aren't really hard to do providing a

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
creative vision for them it's

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
not it's not easy if you live in

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000
and day.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Well it did happen I mean I did move away

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
and go away. It it

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
didn't stop my commitment to the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
neighborhood at that time in my life.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
It was important it was just important because a thing is that this was where I grew up in this is

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
was what I loved. I mean you know it was it

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
was where a lot of my friends were and people whom I knew the parents

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
of my friends.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
So it was something that you know you had you just felt that you had to do something to get back.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
But then you know things changed. You know in. I

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
was in Lee started college in one thousand nine hundred sixty seven and I

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
went on for three years and it was probably the most.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You know during school was very active in a lot of different

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
things still in that community and you know was always a movement always

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
campaign always something going on so I left and then I started working

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
for Catholic Charities as a group worker. You know what goes around comes around

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
you know that I was approached to become

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
the deputy director and I went on to do

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
that big time a lot of this to work is coming in and

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
helping to you know a lot of the stuff

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
as as young as I was and sometimes younger.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
They had graduated from college and sort of stuff and I was looking at this whole situation they said you

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
know maybe I should go back to school so after a period of time I thought it was

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
in my best interest.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And at that point also the best interests of the community they go

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
off to college to return to college and finish my my

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
my college education and that's what I did and I wound up.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Williams College and northwest corner Massachusetts in the purple

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Valley political science.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Well then I went to

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Yale graduated. WILLIAMS When C.E.O. went to the school the

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
organization manager did not finish.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
There came back went to work in

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Washington as a legislative director for Congressman in the South Bronx got involved in

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
the South Bronx handled all of his housing

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
legislation banking and he says he sat on the housing banking and everyone fares Committee and he did

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
a lot of the work on that area and then I

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
went left him after a few years and were doing the South

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Bronx rehabilitation. You know the whole commitment by Carter and

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Reagan to do something but the sub. Did a lot of the work. Planning on the housing side.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
So that

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
well I really never left New York. I

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
mean you know I mean New Jersey now that's something that's the sad part of the dream things

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
have but you know

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I after I went to college I went

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
to Williams So obviously and then I went to Yale.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Then I came back to New York for a very short period of time and then I went to Washington for

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
for a couple years but I was doing the back and forth from New York to Washington because of

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
the some of the constituency work in the to be done and also some of the you know the

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
policy stuff that had to be done then

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I stayed in New

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
York when I worked for the South Bronx development office and then I

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
worked for. Sesame

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Street assistant the president for by legal affairs.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
I

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
worked for Star and housing as a direct of community relations

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
work for St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital handling their housing stuff.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Then I went to work for fifty houses doing their housing stuff in

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
the small not for profit over here called the

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
door central tenet of his which is on room and board

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
and six that I knew and then I got to the Port Authority. So I've been with them

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
for twenty some odd years now.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And a tenor and all over the place very different sort

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.000
of

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
work you know. Do you have any opinion

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
on the changes and that's the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
only guy you

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
know I had I had lunch.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I had lunch with a bunch of friends from the

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Lasorda stays you know the attorney who worked for. The actual legal services

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
who's basically one of the

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
the found not the founders but the catalyst to this was heading to

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
the near front of our minds that we maintain a relationship. For forty some

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
odd years who was the director when I

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
was there will be Vargas. And if you come across

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
him whom I've known

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
forever and in we sat there

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
talking about that same issue feeling about Linspire and how it's evolved and how

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.000
it's

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
changed how these pieces of real estate like for instance

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
my parents bought that house nine hundred fifty for about thirty of that for having used

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
three family houses retail for seventeen thousand

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
dollars and in one thousand nine hundred

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
seventy two because of the redlining mortgage real

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
want Lee mortgage redlining where the banks would literally

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
jor red line around the map and say we will not

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
land within that red line. So that's how the term came out to be redlining.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
So my parents sold the house in one thousand nine hundred seventy two.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Could not get a mortgage the people could not get a mortgage to get what they call the purchase money mortgage

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
and he sold it to seventeen thousand five hundred dollars.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
He still remember mother's hand says at least I was able to pay the bills. So

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
we lived there for a long time twenty to twenty some odd

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
years the House today is probably worth

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
about four million dollars.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
The change is a tremendous And you know in any gentrified neighborhood you have that type

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
of pressure you have that type of you know financial incentives

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
and for people you know to leave the school the

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
leave the area and stuff like that. And you

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
know. Why shouldn't those who live there for twenty

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
years that are retiring now have an opportunity

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
to pull in enormous amount of equity to go somewhere else where they really want

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
to be whether it's going to be for

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Lando Florida back to Puerto Rico. You know or wherever and have a

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
really great nest egg but the cost of that is

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
enormous hugely enormous simply that

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
you know. Years that people have

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.000
invested in

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
maintaining affordable housing maintaining

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
community doing to organize organizational work all of a sudden

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
just disappears. It's rough. It's rough you know

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
the division

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
of of water communicant be like of sudden gets wiped away

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
twenty years of work just down the train more or less for what to

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
become

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
become what you know become like the hipster place.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
You know where very few people can afford to live. So

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
it's with mixed emotion. You

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
know did we do a good job. Do we do it in quite incredible job.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.000
I don't

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
know I look at it from the point of view of you know if it

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
were my father and mother retiring

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
in the one nine hundred seventy two and they're able to pull three four million dollars out of

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
out of the the building that they they maintained and you

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
know all that sort of stuff and Raible to go back to Puerto Rico and

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
not worry about money and scrape you know scrape and even their retirement they had no pension.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
You know. And no pension or my parents live on their Social Security which is not very

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
much they had a great life pale in their own house everything but it wasn't it

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
wasn't you know anything phenomenal.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
But they were happy I mean that's the important thing you know this matter if they had. Well they had a hundred

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
thousand miles they were happy you know.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000
So

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
anything else like that

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
cater

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
to people.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Well situated because the thing is I was down there not very long ago

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
and and I'm not quite sure quite sure if I could never go back.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Let me rephrase that I can never afford to go back.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
But even if I had the money to go back. I don't think I would

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
want to go back. It's changed much to my just now but you know it's not the type

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
of neighborhood that such was my memories it's not the type of neighborhood

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
rather I'd want to be

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
and I don't think

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
anything you think about it's just

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
not my type of neighborhood means

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
my kids type of neighborhood.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I find it amusing that my kids invite me to dinner.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And I look at the stores is all that was King Charles and that was the Armenian and now I see

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
him you know who placed food that's not that's different and stuff like

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
that the apartment to their living room apartment is where

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
we're you know in the one nine hundred seventy S. we were demonstrating against

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
the against

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
the developers you know her high Kraus and stuff like that and now you know my

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
daughter's sort of living there you know for a period of

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
time and not knowing any of the history here and in even if I explained that

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
she wouldn't

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
understand

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
you know much here.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
You're quite welcome and thank you for coming over here from the wilds of

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Brooklyn.
